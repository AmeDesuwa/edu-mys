Conrad sits at a desk, notes spread before him. Mark stands nearby.

Conrad: Let me review what we know.
Conrad: Six students received notes. Each note references a specific moral failing or questionable decision.
Mark: Ben witnessed cheating. Alice took credit for others' work. What about the others?
Conrad: Ryan ignored bullying. Ria was dishonest with a friend. Two others made similar choices.
Conrad: The pattern is clear - someone is identifying students who acted unethically and confronting them.
Mark: But why? What's the endgame?
Conrad: That's what bothers me. Is this punishment? Education? Some kind of social experiment?

"Diwata Laya" materializes, her expression thoughtful.
"Diwata Laya": [i][color=#9999ff]These notes carry intention, but not malice.[/color][/i]
"Conrad (Thinking)": What do you sense?
"Diwata Laya": [i][color=#9999ff]Whoever writes them believes they are helping. Guiding.[/color][/i]
"Diwata Laya": [i][color=#9999ff]But their method lacks wisdom. They push without permission, judge without understanding.[/color][/i]
"Conrad (Thinking)": So not an enemy, but not an ally either.
"Diwata Laya": [i][color=#9999ff]Someone who has learned about teaching, but not yet about compassion.[/color][/i]

Conrad: Laya's right. This feels like someone trying to imitate moral teaching but missing the point.
Mark: Like they read a book about psychology and decided to play therapist?
Conrad: Exactly.
Conrad: We need to find the source. Who has access to this much information about students?
Mark: Teachers? The counselor? Student council?
Conrad: Or someone who observes very carefully. Someone who pays attention.
The Principal enters the room.
join Principal (half) rightmost
Principal: Conrad. I'm glad you're looking into this.
Principal: Parents are starting to call. Students feel targeted, watched.
Principal: Do you have any leads?
Conrad: I need to check the library. Some of these notes reference obscure psychological concepts.
Conrad: Whoever is doing this has been studying moral philosophy and behavioral psychology.
Principal: The library keeps records of book checkouts. I'll authorize your access.
Conrad: Thank you. There's one more thing.
Conrad: Has anyone asked about student records recently? Grades, behavior reports, anything like that?
Principal: No. Those are strictly confidential. Even teachers can only access their own students.
Conrad: Then our note-writer is gathering information another way. Observation, rumors, or...
Mark: Or they found something. A resource we don't know about.
Conrad: Let's check the library.

The library is quiet. A few students study at tables.
Conrad approaches the circulation desk.
Conrad: Excuse me. I need to check recent book checkouts, particularly psychology and philosophy sections.
The librarian pulls up records on her computer.
Librarian: Let's see... several students have checked out ethics texts recently. That's not unusual.
Librarian: But there is something odd. Someone accessed the restricted archive section twice last week.
Conrad: The archive? Who has permission?
Librarian: Faculty, seniors working on thesis projects, and special permission cases.
Librarian: According to the log... it was Alex. She signed out for historical research.
Mark: Alex? I know her. She's in our grade. Always studying, very serious.
Conrad: What was she researching?
Librarian: Her sign-in form said "educational history project for Advanced Studies class."
Conrad: Can we access the archive?
Librarian: With permission, yes. Let me get the key.

Conrad: Before we go to the archive, let me think about our suspects.
Mark: Who should we focus on?
- Alex seems most likely - she accessed the archive. [if {c4s2_alex_tried} == false]
	set {c4s2_alex_tried} = true
	Conrad: Alex accessed the archive twice. That's unusual for a history project.
	Conrad: She's also known for being very principled, almost judgmental about others' behavior.
	Mark: So she could be the type to think she's helping people improve?
	Conrad: Exactly. Let's focus on her.
	jump continue_investigation
- Maybe a teacher is orchestrating this. [if {c4s2_teacher_tried} == false]
	set {c4s2_teacher_tried} = true
	Mark: Teachers have access to archives and student information.
	Conrad: But the Principal said no teacher has been asking about records.
	Conrad: And the notes feel... amateur. Like someone learned this from books, not experience.
	Mark: So probably not a teacher?
	Conrad: Probably not. Let's keep looking.
	jump suspect_choice
- Could it be someone working with B.C.? [if {c4s2_bc_tried} == false]
	set {c4s2_bc_tried} = true
	Mark: What if B.C. is behind this after all?
	Conrad: I don't think so. The style is completely different.
	Conrad: B.C.'s cards are patient, elegant, timed perfectly.
	Conrad: These notes are rushed, invasive, clumsy.
	Mark: So a copycat?
	Conrad: More likely someone inspired by the idea, but without B.C.'s wisdom.

Conrad: Alex is our strongest lead. Let's check what she was looking at in the archive.
