The school hallway buzzes with nervous energy. Students cluster in small groups, whispering.

join Mark (Mark_half) right
Mark: Have you heard? Students are getting weird anonymous notes.
Conrad: Notes? What kind?
Mark: Puzzles, riddles, moral dilemmas. Some of them are pretty creepy.
Mark: At first people thought it was a prank. But now... six students have gotten them.
Conrad: And the school asked me to look into it?
Mark: Not officially. But you know how word spreads. "Conrad solved three mysteries. Maybe he can figure this out too."
Conrad: Show me one of the notes.

join Ben (half) center
Ben holds a folded piece of paper, looking uncomfortable.
Ben: I found this in my locker yesterday morning. No idea who put it there.
Ben hands the note to Conrad.
Conrad reads aloud.
Conrad: "You witnessed your friend cheat on the exam but said nothing. Silence protects the guilty. What does that make you?"
Conrad: When did this happen?
Ben shifts nervously.
Ben: Last week. My friend... I didn't want to get him in trouble. But now I feel like someone's watching me, judging me.
Conrad: Have you told anyone else?
Ben: No. The note said 'this is between you and your conscience.'
Conrad: May I keep this?
Ben nods, looking relieved to be rid of it.

Mark: That's harsh. Whoever wrote this knows personal details about students.
Conrad: It's targeted. Specific. Not random.
Conrad examines the note carefully.
Conrad: The handwriting is neat, deliberate. The paper is standard school supply.
Conrad: But the content... it's designed to provoke guilt and self-reflection.
Mark: Like a psychological experiment?
Conrad: Or a moral lesson. Someone thinks they're teaching.
join Alice (half) rightmost
Alice approaches, carrying her own note.
Alice: Conrad? I heard you're looking into these notes. I got one too.
Conrad: What does yours say?
Alice: "You take credit for group work while others do the labor. Recognition without effort is theft."
Alice looks down, ashamed.
Alice: It's true. I have been letting others carry me in group projects. But how does this person know?
Conrad: They're observing. Watching student behavior closely.
Alice: It feels invasive. Like someone's keeping files on all of us.
Mark: Conrad, this is different from the B.C. cards you've found, right?
Conrad nods slowly.
Conrad: Completely different. B.C.'s cards appear after we solve a case. They're elegant, philosophical.
Conrad: These notes are... aggressive. Confrontational. Personal.
Conrad: Whoever is doing this isn't B.C. They're someone else entirely.
leave Alice
Mark: So we have a new mystery on our hands.
Conrad: And it's escalating. Six students so far. If we don't find who's behind this, more will follow.
