A week after the broken sculpture case...
The library archive is quiet, dusty, and forgotten. Shelves tower in the dim light, packed with decades of records.

Alex searches through old filing cabinets, looking for reference materials for a history project.
Alex: Let's see... 1995, 1996... no, too recent. I need something from the early 90s.
She pulls open a drawer that resists at first, then jerks open with a groan.
Alex: What's this?
A leather-bound journal sits wedged behind the files, hidden deliberately.
Alex carefully lifts it out, brushing off dust.
Alex: "Educational Philosophy and Moral Development." No author listed.
She opens to the first page and begins reading.
Alex: "Observation teaches lessons that lectures cannot. Students learn best when challenged to think, not told what to think."
Alex: This is... interesting.
She flips through pages filled with psychological puzzles, moral dilemmas, and notes about student behavior.
Alex: "Case Study 3: Student A cheated because they feared disappointing their parents. Rather than punish, I created a scenario where honesty was rewarded."
Alex: Whoever wrote this was trying to teach through experience, not authority.
She continues reading, fascinated.
Alex: "The best lessons come from discovery. When students solve problems themselves, they internalize the moral far deeper than any lecture could achieve."
Alex thinks of Conrad and his detective work - solving cases that taught real lessons.
Alex: Conrad does this. He helps people learn by uncovering truth.
Alex: What if... what if I could do something similar?
Alex: These puzzles, these challenges... I could use them to help other students grow.
She closes the journal, decision made.
Alex: The person who wrote this understood something important. Knowledge isn't just about facts.
Alex: It's about becoming better people through experience.
Alex: I'm going to continue what they started.

The next day...
Anonymous notes begin appearing in student lockers.
Each one contains a puzzle, a challenge, a moral question.
The students who receive them are confused, curious, and some are frightened.
They don't understand who is testing them, or why.
But someone is watching. Observing their reactions.
Taking notes, just like the journal taught.
