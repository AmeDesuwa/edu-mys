Principal: Alex. Conrad explained what happened.
Alex: I'm sorry, Principal. I took the journal without permission and used it inappropriately.
Alex: I thought I was helping, but I understand now that I caused harm.
Alex places the journal on the desk.
Principal: This journal has been missing for over twenty years. I'm surprised it was still in the archive.
Principal picks it up, examining it thoughtfully.
Principal: This belonged to a teacher who left the school in 1995.
Principal: They were brilliant but misguided. They believed students should be challenged constantly, tested, observed.
Principal: Eventually, parents complained. Students felt manipulated. The teacher resigned.
Principal: We kept the journal as a cautionary example of good intentions gone wrong.
Alex: I see that now. I'm truly sorry.
Principal: Your consequences will be fair but clear.
Principal: You'll write apology letters to each student who received a note.
Principal: You'll serve detention for unauthorized use of school property.
Principal: And you'll assist the guidance counselor in organizing a proper peer mentorship program.
Principal: One that respects consent and boundaries.
Alex: I accept all of that. Thank you for giving me a chance to make this right.

Mark: That went better than expected.
Conrad: Alex isn't a bad person. She just made a mistake.
Mark: A mistake that could have caused real damage.
Conrad: True. But she's learning. That's what matters.
Conrad: She wanted to help people grow. Now she's growing herself.
Mark: You think she'll be okay?
Conrad: I think she'll be better than okay. This experience taught her something important.
Conrad: Knowledge alone isn't enough. You need wisdom, empathy, and humility.
Mark: Heavy lesson for one week.
Conrad smiles slightly.
Conrad: The best lessons usually are.
Mark: So what now?
Conrad: Now we verify the journal is properly stored and close this case.
Conrad: Let's go to the archive.
