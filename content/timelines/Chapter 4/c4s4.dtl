The library reading room is quiet. Alex sits alone at a table, surrounded by books and notes.

Conrad approaches carefully and sits across from her.
Conrad: Alex. We need to talk.
Alex looks up, and for a moment, her expression flickers with something - fear? Guilt?
Alex: Conrad. About what?
Conrad: About the journal you found in the archive. The one about experimental pedagogy.
Alex's face goes pale.
Alex: I... I don't know what you're talking about.
Conrad: The archive access log shows you were there twice. The journal is missing from its catalogued location.
Conrad: And the mysterious notes started appearing two days after your first visit.

Mark: We're not here to get you in trouble, Alex. We just want to understand.
Alex's shoulders slump. She sets down her pen.
Alex: You wouldn't understand.
Conrad: Try us.
Alex takes a shaky breath.
Alex: I found the journal by accident. I was looking for something else and it was just... there.
Alex: Hidden behind old files. Like someone wanted it forgotten.
Alex: When I started reading, I was fascinated. The author described teaching students through experiences, through challenges that made them think deeply about their choices.
Conrad: And you decided to continue their work.
Alex: I thought... I thought I could help people. Like you do, Conrad.
Alex: You solve mysteries and people learn from them. They grow. They change.
Alex: I wanted to do that too. To help my classmates become better people.
Conrad: By judging them? By confronting them with their mistakes?
Alex: Not judging. Teaching. The journal explained how guilt can be a teacher, how self-reflection leads to growth.
Mark: But Alex, you were making people feel watched, targeted, unsafe.
Alex looks genuinely shocked.
Alex: I... I didn't mean to frighten anyone. I thought they'd appreciate the guidance.

Conrad leans forward, voice gentle but firm.
Conrad: Alex, think about how you felt when you found the journal.
Conrad: Did you ask permission to take it? Did you consult anyone about whether this was appropriate?
Alex: No, but... I thought—
Conrad: You thought you knew better. You thought having knowledge was enough.
Conrad: But knowledge without wisdom is dangerous. You learned techniques without understanding context.
Conrad: The person who wrote that journal? They left the school. Do you know why?
Alex shakes her head.
Conrad: Because their methods, however well-intentioned, crossed ethical lines.
Conrad: They manipulated students without consent. They caused harm while trying to teach.
Conrad: You found their methods and repeated their mistakes.
Alex's eyes begin to fill with tears.
Alex: I just... I wanted to help. I wanted to matter, to make a difference like you do.
Mark: Conrad helps people who ask for help. He doesn't force lessons on people.
Conrad: The students you sent notes to didn't consent to your teaching.
Conrad: You violated their privacy, judged their choices, and made them feel unsafe.
Conrad: That's not teaching. That's manipulation.
Alex covers her face with her hands.
Alex: What have I done? I thought I was doing something good.
Conrad: You had good intentions. But intentions aren't enough.
Conrad: Real wisdom is knowing when you don't have the right to interfere in someone else's life.
Alex: I'm so sorry. To you, to the students I hurt, to everyone.
Conrad: Apologizing is a start. But you need to return the journal and face the consequences.
Alex nods, wiping her eyes.
Alex: I will. I'll return it today and apologize to everyone.
Alex: Conrad... how do you know when it's right to help someone?
Conrad: When they ask. Or when someone is in immediate danger.
Conrad: Otherwise, the best help is offering, not forcing. Guidance, not judgment.
Alex: I understand now. I really do.

leave Mark
Conrad sits alone for a moment, reflecting.
Conrad: Knowledge is powerful. But it's not the same as wisdom.
Conrad: Wisdom is knowing not just what to do, but when, and whether you should do it at all.
