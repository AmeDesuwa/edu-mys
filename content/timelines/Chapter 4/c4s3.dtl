The archive is dim, dusty, and cramped. Shelves tower overhead, packed with decades of materials.

Mark: This place is ancient. How are we supposed to find anything?
Conrad: The librarian said Alex was looking at educational records from the 1990s.
Conrad: Let's check that section.
They move to a filing cabinet marked "1990-1995 Educational Materials."
Conrad pulls open a drawer.
Conrad: Wait. There's a gap here. Something's been removed.
Mark: Recently?
Conrad: The dust pattern suggests yes. Within the last week or two.
Conrad: And look at this.
He picks up a small piece of paper that had fallen behind the files.
Conrad: A bookmark. With Alex's name on it from the school bookstore.
Mark: That's pretty solid evidence she was here.
Conrad: But what was she looking for? What did she take?

Conrad examines the archive access log the librarian provided.
Conrad: Alex accessed the archive on two dates: one week ago, and three days ago.
Conrad: The first mysterious note appeared five days ago.
Mark: So she found something a week ago, and started creating notes two days later.
Conrad: After she had time to read and plan.
Conrad checks the remaining files in the drawer.
Conrad: The missing item was catalogued as "Educator's Journal - Anonymous - 1992-1995."
Conrad: Description: "Personal teaching philosophy and experimental pedagogy notes."
Mark: Experimental pedagogy? That sounds like what the notes are - experiments in moral teaching.
Conrad: Exactly. Alex found a journal written by someone who believed in teaching through challenges and observation.
Conrad: She took it, studied it, and started implementing the techniques herself.
Mark: But she's not a teacher. She doesn't have the training to do this ethically.
Conrad: That's the problem. She has the knowledge but not the wisdom to use it properly.
Conrad: We need to talk to her before this escalates further.

Mark: Where do we find Alex?
Conrad: She usually studies in the library reading room during free period.
Mark: Should we confront her there?
Conrad: We need to be careful. She thinks she's helping people.
Conrad: If we approach this as an attack, she'll get defensive.
Mark: So we talk to her like... a misguided ally?
Conrad: Exactly. She's not our enemy. She's someone who needs to understand why what she's doing is harmful.
