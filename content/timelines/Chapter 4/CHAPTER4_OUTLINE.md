# Chapter 4: The Hidden Journal

## Theme
**Wisdom** - Knowledge must be used responsibly and ethically

## Case Overview
Someone has discovered an old journal in the library archive containing psychological puzzles and moral challenges. This person begins using the journal's contents to manipulate students through anonymous notes and challenges, believing they're "teaching lessons." Conrad must find out who has the journal and stop them before the manipulation escalates.

## Structure (7 scenes: c4s0 - c4s6)

### c4s0 - Prologue: The Discovery
- **Location**: Library archive (evening)
- **Characters**: A student (new character: Alex - can reuse existing Alex character)
- **Content**: Alex discovers the leather-bound journal hidden in the archive. Reads entries about "teaching through observation" and "moral puzzles." Decides to use it to "help" fellow students by creating challenges.
- **Tone**: Misguided good intentions, not malicious

### c4s1 - The Mysterious Notes
- **Location**: Classroom, hallway
- **Characters**: Conrad, Mark, students receiving notes
- **Incident**: Several students receive anonymous notes with puzzles and moral dilemmas. The notes reference past cases and challenge them to "prove their worth." Students are confused and worried.
- **Conrad's reaction**: This feels different from B.C.'s cards - more invasive, less elegant

### c4s2 - Investigation Begins
- **Location**: Classroom, library
- **Characters**: Conrad, Mark, Laya, Principal, affected students
- **Investigation**: Conrad interviews students who received notes. Laya senses these notes lack the "ancient patience" of B.C.'s cards. Evidence gathering begins.
- **Clue**: Handwriting analysis, paper type, puzzle style
- **Choice mechanic**: Which lead to follow first?

### c4s3 - The Archive Discovery
- **Location**: Library archive
- **Characters**: Conrad, Mark, Librarian, Laya
- **Discovery**: Conrad finds evidence that someone has been accessing the restricted archive section. Discovers the journal is missing from its original location.
- **Minigame**: Logic puzzle about library access patterns
- **Level-up**: Conrad reaches level 7

### c4s4 - Confrontation
- **Location**: Library or study area
- **Characters**: Conrad, Mark, Alex (the culprit)
- **Revelation**: Conrad confronts Alex with evidence. Alex admits to taking the journal and creating the notes, believing they were helping students "grow" through challenges like the journal described.
- **Alex's motivation**: Admiration for Conrad's detective work + misguided desire to help others learn
- **Laya's insight**: Knowledge without wisdom leads to harm, even with good intentions

### c4s5 - Resolution
- **Location**: Principal's office
- **Characters**: Conrad, Mark, Alex, Principal, Laya
- **Outcome**: Alex returns the journal and apologizes. Principal explains the journal's history - it belonged to a former educator who believed in experiential learning but left the school when methods became too manipulative.
- **Consequence**: Alex must write apology letters and help organize a proper mentorship program
- **Theme reinforcement**: Knowledge is powerful; using it requires wisdom and consent

### c4s6 - The Fourth Card
- **Location**: Library archive
- **Characters**: Conrad, Mark, Laya
- **B.C. Card Discovery**: Conrad finds the journal properly stored back in the archive. Inside is a B.C. card.
- **Card message**: "Lesson 4: Wisdom. Knowledge illuminates, but wisdom guides. The eager student learned what the patient teacher already knew."
- **Revelation**: B.C. knew about the journal all along. Perhaps even intended for this to happen as part of Conrad's education.
- **Level-up**: Conrad reaches level 8
- **Forward momentum**: Four lessons complete. The chain continues.

## Assets Needed

### Backgrounds
1. **library_archive.png** - Dusty archive with old books and filing cabinets (can be dim/atmospheric)
2. Can reuse: classroom.png, hallway.png, principal_office.png (if these exist, otherwise use existing backgrounds)

### Characters
1. **Alex** - Reuse existing Alex character (c:\Users\kshin\Documents\edu-mys\content\characters\Alex.dch)
2. **Principal** - Reuse existing Principal character
3. **Librarian** - Optional new character OR can be mentioned/described without sprite (simpler)

### Props
- The journal can be described, doesn't need visual asset

## Minigame
**Library access puzzle** - Logic/deduction minigame about figuring out who accessed the archive
- Type: Fill-in-the-blank or matching puzzle
- Content: Matching timestamps, student schedules, and access records

## Lesson Progression
1. Chapter 1: **Truth** - Honesty and evidence
2. Chapter 2: **Responsibility** - Accountability for actions
3. Chapter 3: **Creativity** - Expression vs competition
4. Chapter 4: **Wisdom** - Using knowledge ethically

## Notes
- Alex is misguided, not malicious (different from previous antagonists)
- The journal becomes a plot device that deepens B.C. mystery
- Suggests B.C. has been guiding Conrad through increasingly complex moral situations
- Sets up future chapters where B.C.'s identity might be revealed
