A few days later. Art Week continues, transformed by what happened.
The spot where "The Reader" once stood now holds something new.

Mark: What's that? Where Mia's sculpture used to be?
Conrad approaches the pedestal.
A collaborative piece stands in place of the broken sculpture.
Dozens of small clay hands, each made by a different student, reach upward together, holding an open book.
A plaque reads: "Together We Rise - A collaborative tribute to The Reader."
Conrad: The art club made this. Each student contributed a hand.
Mark: Even Victor?
Conrad: Even Victor. His is the one in the center.
Mark: That's... actually kind of beautiful.
Conrad: Mia said art is about sharing. Looks like everyone learned that lesson.
They stand in comfortable silence, admiring the piece.
Mark: Hey, what's that?
He points to something tucked behind the pedestal.
Conrad reaches down and pulls out a small, elegant card.
Conrad: Another one.
Mark: B.C.?
Conrad nods, reading aloud.
Conrad: "Lesson 3: Creativity."
Conrad: "True artists create to express, not to compete."
Conrad: "Envy sees another's light and tries to extinguish it, not realizing it could have warmed them both."
Conrad: "The jealous heart destroys what it cannot possess. The wise heart learns to admire what it cannot be."
Mark: That's... actually really relevant.
Conrad continues reading.
Conrad: "Well done, detectives. The chain continues."
Conrad: "Signed... B.C."
Mark: Three cases. Three lessons. Three cards.
Mark: Truth. Responsibility. Creativity.
Mark: What's the pattern here?
Conrad: Someone's teaching us. Through these mysteries.
Mark: But who? And why?

"Diwata Laya" appears, her eyes fixed on the card.
"Diwata Laya": B.C. Their presence grows stronger with each lesson.
"Diwata Laya": They are not merely watching. They are guiding.
Conrad: Guiding us toward what?
"Diwata Laya": I cannot see the end. Only the path unfolding.
"Diwata Laya": But each lesson builds on the last. Truth. Responsibility. Creativity.
"Diwata Laya": These are not random values. They form something larger.
Mark: A curriculum?
"Diwata Laya": Perhaps. Or a test. Preparing you for something to come.
Conrad: Who is B.C.?
"Diwata Laya" shakes her head slowly.
"Diwata Laya": Even I cannot pierce that veil. They exist outside my sight.
"Diwata Laya": But I sense no malice. Only purpose. Ancient and patient.

leave "Diwata Laya"
Mark: A mysterious teacher who leaves cryptic cards after we solve crimes.
Mark: Our lives have gotten weird, Conrad.
Conrad: Weird, but meaningful.
Conrad looks at the collaborative sculpture.
Conrad: Victor wanted to be seen. To matter.
Conrad: But he was looking for validation in the wrong places.
Conrad: Competition pushed him to improve. But when it became about tearing others down...
Mark: That's when it stopped being about the art.
Conrad: Exactly. Creation should lift people up. Not tear them down.
Conrad: Victor had real skill. He just forgot why he started making art in the first place.
Mark: And Mia?
Conrad: She never forgot. That's why her work resonates.
Conrad: It's not about technique. It's about connection.

Mark stretches, looking at the setting sun.
Mark: Three cases solved. Three mysterious cards.
Mark: Think there'll be more?
Conrad: "The chain continues." That's what B.C. said.
Conrad: There will definitely be more.
Mark: Then we'll be ready.
Conrad: Together.
They share a smile.
Mark: Come on. Let's get some food. All this detective work makes me hungry.
Conrad: Everything makes you hungry, Mark.
Mark: Fair point.
They walk away from the courtyard, leaving the collaborative sculpture glowing in the afternoon light.
leave Conrad
leave Mark
The B.C. card sits on the pedestal beside the sculpture.
The wind ruffles its edge, but it stays in place.
Watching.
Waiting.
The chain continues.
