Victor stands near the edge of the courtyard, watching students pass by his ignored display.

Conrad: Victor. We need to talk.
Victor's eyes flicker with something - fear? Defiance?
Victor: I already told you everything I know.
Conrad: You told me you were home all night. That was a lie.
Victor's jaw tightens.
Victor: I don't know what you're talking about.
Conrad: I found a receipt in your sketchbook. Art supply store, 8:47 PM.
Conrad: You weren't home. You were out.
Victor: So I went shopping. That doesn't mean I came here.
Conrad: Then explain this.
Conrad holds up the paint cloth in a clear bag.
Conrad: Found at the scene of the crime. Right next to the broken sculpture.
Victor: That could belong to anyone. We all use cloths like that.
Conrad: This one has an inventory tag. Number 14-C.
Conrad: That's your cabinet number, Victor. Your assigned supplies.
Victor's face goes pale.
Victor: That... someone must have stolen it. Framed me.
Conrad: The sketchbook. The receipt. The cloth. Your resentment toward Mia.
Conrad: At what point do coincidences stop being coincidences?
Victor: You don't understand!
Conrad: Then help me understand.

Mark: We're not trying to destroy you, Victor. We just want the truth.
Victor looks between them, his defiance crumbling.
His hands begin to shake.

"Diwata Laya" appears beside Conrad, visible only to him.
"Diwata Laya": [i][color=#9999ff]His walls are falling. He wants to confess.[/color][/i]
"Diwata Laya": [i][color=#9999ff]But he's afraid. Afraid of what comes next.[/color][/i]
"Conrad (Thinking)": What should I do?
"Diwata Laya": [i][color=#9999ff]Show him you understand his pain. He needs to feel seen, not judged.[/color][/i]

Conrad's tone softens.
Conrad: Victor. I've read your sketchbook.
Conrad: Not just the angry parts. The technical studies. The hours of practice.
Conrad: You're talented. Really talented.
Victor looks up, surprised.
Conrad: But you've been hurting for a long time. Feeling invisible.
Conrad: Feeling like no matter how hard you work, no one sees you.
Victor's eyes begin to glisten.
Victor: You... you don't know what it's like.
Victor: Every competition, every exhibition, every award. It's always someone else.
Victor: I practice twice as much as anyone. I study the masters. I perfect my technique.
Victor: And Mia just... feels her way through it. No discipline. No rigor.
Victor: Yet everyone calls her a genius and ignores me.
Conrad: That must be incredibly painful.
Victor's voice breaks.
Victor: My parents keep asking why I can't be more like her.
Victor: My father says art is a waste of time unless you're the best.
Victor: And I can't be the best. Not with Mia around.
Mark: So you destroyed her sculpture.
Victor collapses onto a nearby bench, his head in his hands.
Victor: I didn't mean to. I just... I wanted to see it gone.
Victor: I thought if her work disappeared, people would finally look at mine.
Victor: But they didn't. They just kept talking about her. "Poor Mia. Her beautiful sculpture."
Victor: It's always about her.
Conrad: You wrote the note. "Not everyone deserves to shine."
Victor nods weakly.
Victor: I thought... I thought I deserved to shine. More than her.
Victor: But now I just feel empty.
Victor: Destroying her art didn't make mine better. It just made me... this.
He looks up at Conrad, tears streaming down his face.
Victor: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Conrad: You need to tell Ms. Reyes. And Mia.
Victor: I know.
Conrad: This isn't going to go away. There will be consequences.
Victor: I know that too.
Victor stands, wiping his eyes.
Victor: I just wanted someone to see me. To say my work mattered.
Victor: But not like this. Never like this.

Conrad stands alone in the courtyard, watching Victor walk toward the art room.
Conrad: Every case teaches something.
Conrad: But the lessons aren't always easy.
