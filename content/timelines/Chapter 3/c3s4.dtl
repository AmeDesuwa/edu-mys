Conrad: Victor. We need to talk.
Victor's eyes flicker with something - fear? Defiance?
Victor: I already told you everything I know.
Conrad: You told me you were home all night. That was a lie.
Victor's jaw tightens.
Victor: I don't know what you're talking about.
Conrad: I found a receipt in your sketchbook. Art supply store, 8:47 PM.
Conrad: You weren't home. You were out.
Victor: So I went shopping. That doesn't mean I came here.
Conrad: Then explain this.
Conrad holds up the paint cloth in a clear bag.
Conrad: Found at the scene of the crime. Right next to the broken sculpture.
Victor: That could belong to anyone. We all use cloths like that.
Conrad: This one has an inventory tag. Number 14-C.
Conrad: That's your cabinet number, Victor. Your assigned supplies.
Victor's face goes pale.
Victor: That... someone must have stolen it. Framed me.
Conrad: The sketchbook. The receipt. The cloth. Your resentment toward Mia.
Conrad: At what point do coincidences stop being coincidences?
Victor: You don't understand!
Conrad: Then help me understand.

Victor looks between them, his defiance crumbling.
His hands begin to shake.

Conrad's tone softens.
Conrad: Victor. I've read your sketchbook.
Conrad: Not just the angry parts. The technical studies. The hours of practice.
Conrad: You're talented. Really talented.
Victor looks up, surprised.
Conrad: But you've been hurting for a long time. Feeling invisible.
Conrad: Feeling like no matter how hard you work, no one sees you.
Victor's eyes begin to glisten.
Victor: You... you don't know what it's like.
Victor: Every competition, every exhibition, every award. It's always someone else.
Victor: I practice twice as much as anyone. I study the masters. I perfect my technique.
Victor: And Mia just... feels her way through it. No discipline. No rigor.
Victor: Yet everyone calls her a genius and ignores me.
Conrad: That must be incredibly painful.
Victor's voice breaks.
Victor: My parents keep asking why I can't be more like her.
Victor: My father says art is a waste of time unless you're the best.
Victor: And I can't be the best. Not with Mia around.
Mark: So you destroyed her sculpture.
Victor collapses onto a nearby bench, his head in his hands.
Victor: I didn't mean to. I just... I wanted to see it gone.
Victor: I thought if her work disappeared, people would finally look at mine.
Victor: But they didn't. They just kept talking about her. "Poor Mia. Her beautiful sculpture."
Victor: It's always about her.
Conrad: You wrote the note. "Not everyone deserves to shine."
Victor nods weakly.
Victor: I thought... I thought I deserved to shine. More than her.
Victor: But now I just feel empty.
Victor: Destroying her art didn't make mine better. It just made me... this.
He looks up at Conrad, tears streaming down his face.
Victor: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Conrad: Tell me exactly what happened that night.
Victor: I... okay.

The evening before Art Week...
The art room is empty except for one student, working under the dim glow of a desk lamp.

Victor sits hunched over a sculpture, his hands moving with mechanical precision.
Victor: Twenty-three hours. That's how long this took.
He leans back, examining his work - a geometric abstract piece, technically flawless.
Victor: Every angle calculated. Every proportion perfect.

He picks up his phone, scrolling through photos.
Victor: And Mia spent... what? A few weeks on hers?

Victor's expression darkens as he stares at a photo of "The Reader."
Victor: "Emotionally transcendent." That's what the judges said.
Victor: They didn't even look at mine. One glance and they moved on.

His hands clench into fists.
Victor: Dad was right. Second place is first loser.

Victor's voice cracks.
Victor: I've tried so hard, Dad. I've given everything.
Victor: But it's never enough. I'm never enough.
He stares at his reflection in the darkened window.
Victor: At school, I'm invisible. At home, I'm a disappointment.
Victor: The only time anyone notices me is when I fail.
A tear slides down his cheek. He wipes it away angrily.
Victor: Tomorrow is Art Week. Everyone will gather around Mia's sculpture.
Victor: They'll take photos. They'll applaud. They'll call her a genius.
Victor: And I'll stand next to my perfect, soulless piece... alone.

Victor's eyes drift to "The Reader" visible through the window, illuminated by moonlight in the courtyard.
Victor: Unless...
He shakes his head violently.
Victor: No. I can't. That's insane.

But his gaze keeps returning to the window.
Victor: If it's gone... people would have to look at something else.
Victor: They'd have to look at... me.
He stands abruptly, knocking over his chair.
Victor: Just once. I want someone to see my work first.
Victor: Is that so wrong?

Victor stumbles backward, staring at what he's done.
Victor: What... what have I done?
Victor: This won't bring them to me. This won't make Dad proud.

He turns and flees into the darkness.
Something small falls from his pocket, landing silently among the debris.
