Art Week. The courtyard buzzes with excitement as students gather around colorful displays.
Paintings line the walls. Sculptures stand on pedestals. The air smells of fresh paint and possibility.

Mark: Man, after the exam sabotage and the missing fund... it's nice to have something normal for once.
Conrad: "Normal" is relative. But yes, this is refreshing.
Mark: Two cases solved. You're getting quite the reputation, you know.
Conrad: I'm just following the evidence. Anyone could do it.
Mark: Not anyone has a mysterious spirit guide helping them.
Conrad shoots Mark a warning look.
Conrad: Keep your voice down.
Mark: Relax, no one's listening. They're all too busy with the art.
Mark gestures at the colorful displays surrounding them.
Mark: Speaking of which - have you seen Mia's sculpture? The one that won regionals?
Conrad: "The Reader"? I've heard it's the centerpiece of the exhibit.
Mark: Let's check it out. Everyone's been talking about it.
Conrad: Lead the way.

They walk toward the center of the courtyard.
A crowd has gathered, but something feels wrong.
The murmurs aren't of admiration. They're of shock.

Mark: What's going on? Why does everyone look so...
A student rushes past, face pale.
Student: Someone destroyed Mia's sculpture! It's completely smashed!
Conrad: What?
Conrad pushes through the crowd, his detective instincts taking over.

The sculpture lies shattered on the ground.
Clay fragments spread across the stone tiles. What was once art is now debris.
The pedestal stands empty, its plaque a bitter reminder of what was.

Mia kneels among the pieces, her hands hovering over the fragments as if afraid to touch them.
Tears stream silently down her face.
Mia: Grandpa... I made this for you...
Mia: You always said I could do anything. That my hands could create magic.
Mia: Now it's gone. It's all gone.
Conrad approaches carefully, keeping his voice gentle.
Conrad: Mia?
She looks up, eyes red and hollow.
Mia: Three months. Every night after school. Every weekend.
Mia: My grandfather used to read to me under the mango tree in our backyard.
Mia: He passed away last year. This was... this was my way of keeping him with me.
Conrad: I'm so sorry. Truly.
Mia: Who would do this? Why would anyone want to destroy something made from love?
Conrad notices something on the empty pedestal.
Conrad: Wait. What's that?
A small note is tucked under the edge of the plaque.
Conrad picks it up carefully, reading aloud.
Conrad: "Not everyone deserves to shine."

Mark: Conrad! What happened? Is Mia...
Conrad: Someone destroyed her sculpture deliberately. And left this message.
Conrad shows Mark the note.
Mark: "Not everyone deserves to shine"? That's... that's cruel. Who writes something like that?
Conrad's expression hardens with determination.
Conrad: Someone who feels overshadowed. Someone who wanted to hurt her specifically.
Conrad: This wasn't random vandalism, Mark. This was personal.
He turns to Mia, his voice firm but kind.
Conrad: Mia, I've solved cases like this before. The exam sabotage. The missing outreach fund.
Conrad: I promise you - I'm going to find out who did this and why.
Mia looks up, a fragile hope breaking through her grief.
Mia: You... you're the one who caught Greg? And found the missing money?
Conrad: That's right. And whoever did this made a mistake.
Conrad: They left evidence. Evidence always tells a story.
Conrad crouches near the debris, examining the scene with practiced eyes.
Conrad: The note itself is a clue. Handwritten. Emotional. Personal.
Conrad: The sculpture was pushed, not kicked. Someone got close to it.
Conrad: And... what's this?
He picks up a small piece of cloth, stained with various colors.
Conrad: Paint-stained fabric. Someone dropped this.
Mark: A clue already?
Conrad: The beginning of one.
Conrad straightens, pocketing the cloth and the note carefully.
Conrad: Mark, we have work to do.
Mark: Just like old times.
Conrad: Someone knows something. They always do.
Conrad: Let's start with the art department. I want to know who had access to this courtyard last night.
