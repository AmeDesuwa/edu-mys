The art room feels different now. Quieter. Heavy with the weight of what happened.

Ms. Reyes stands near her desk, her expression a mix of disappointment and sadness.
Victor sits on a stool, shoulders hunched. Mia stands a few feet away, arms wrapped around herself.

"Ms Reyes": Victor. I've always believed in your talent.
"Ms Reyes": But talent without empathy is just... technique. Empty movements.
Victor: I know. I understand that now.
"Ms Reyes": The principal has decided on your consequences.
"Ms Reyes": You'll be suspended from the art program for the rest of the semester.
"Ms Reyes": And you'll help organize next year's Art Week. Setting up displays. Supporting other students.
"Ms Reyes": Learning that art is about community, not competition.
Victor nods slowly.
Victor: That's fair.
"Ms Reyes" turns to Mia.
"Ms Reyes": Mia, do you have anything you want to say?

Mia looks at Victor. Her eyes are red, but her expression is not angry.
Mia: Victor... I always thought you were amazing.
Victor looks up, surprised.
Mia: Your technical skill is incredible. The way you render light and shadow...
Mia: I could never do what you do. I just... feel things and try to capture them.
Mia: We're different kinds of artists. Neither is better.
Victor: But everyone loves your work. No one even looks at mine.
Mia: Because you make it hard to connect with you.
Mia: Your art is perfect, but it feels... closed. Like you're trying to prove something.
Mia: Art isn't about proving. It's about sharing.
Victor: I... I never thought of it that way.
Mia: My sculpture wasn't meant to win competitions.
Mia: I made it because I missed my grandfather. I wanted to remember how it felt when he read to me.
Mia: The judges responded to that feeling. Not the technique.
Victor: And I destroyed it because I was jealous.
Victor: I'm so sorry, Mia. I'm so sorry.
Mia takes a deep breath.
Mia: I can't forgive you yet. It hurts too much.
Mia: But... I understand hurt. I understand feeling invisible.
Mia: Destroying my art didn't make yours better. It just destroyed something beautiful.
Mia: I hope you learn from this. I really do.
Victor: I will. I promise I will.
Mia nods slowly, then turns and leaves the room.

Conrad and Mark remain in the art room.
Mark: That was... heavy.
Conrad: Justice isn't always satisfying.
Conrad: Victor will face consequences. But the real punishment is what he's feeling right now.
Mark: Mia was surprisingly kind.
Conrad: She's an artist. She understands that pain can make people do terrible things.
Conrad: That doesn't excuse what Victor did. But understanding matters.
Mark: What happens now?
Conrad: Victor has a chance to change. To learn why he was really hurting.
Conrad: Whether he takes that chance is up to him.
