The art room storage area is cluttered with supplies, half-finished projects, and dusty easels.

Conrad: Each student has their own supply cabinet. Victor's should be here somewhere.
Mark: Is this legal? Going through his stuff?
Conrad: We're not taking anything. Just observing.
Mark gives him a look.
Mark: That's a very specific distinction.
Conrad: Evidence collected properly can help everyone, including Victor if he's innocent.
They move through the storage area.
Conrad: Here. Victor Lim.
Conrad opens the cabinet carefully.
Inside are neatly organized supplies: brushes arranged by size, paints sorted by color, pristine tools.
Conrad: Meticulous. Everything in perfect order.
Mark: So he's organized. Lots of people are organized.
Conrad: Look here.
Conrad pulls out a small bundle of cloth rags, stained with various paint colors.
Conrad: Paint cloths. Let me compare.
He holds up the cloth from the crime scene next to the rags from Victor's cabinet.
Conrad: Same type of fabric. Same paint patterns.
Mark: That's not definitive. All the art students probably use similar cloths.
Conrad: True. We need something more concrete.
Conrad continues searching, then pauses.
Conrad: What's this?
He pulls out a worn sketchbook, its cover marked with Victor's name.
[signal arg="unlock_evidence victor_sketchbook_c3"]
Conrad flips through the pages.
The first half is filled with technical studies: anatomy, perspective, shading techniques.
Then the tone changes.
Conrad: Mark, look at this.
Angry sketches fill the later pages. Crossed-out figures. Dark, violent imagery.
One page shows a sculpture that looks unmistakably like "The Reader" - with harsh X marks drawn over it.
Mark: That's... disturbing.
Conrad: It shows his state of mind. But it's not proof he acted on these feelings.
Conrad: Artists often express dark thoughts through their work. It's actually healthy.
Mark: So what do we need?
Conrad continues through the sketchbook and finds a loose receipt tucked between pages.
Conrad: Hello. What's this?
He examines the receipt.
Conrad: Art supply store. Dated yesterday. Time stamp: 8:47 PM.
[signal arg="unlock_evidence art_store_receipt_c3"]
Mark: That's late. Why would he need supplies so urgently?
Conrad: The store is near the school. If he was there at 8:47, he could easily have come here afterward.
Mark: His alibi was that he was home all night. This proves he was out.
Conrad: It proves he was at the store. Not that he came here.
Conrad: We need something that directly links him to the courtyard last night.
Conrad closes the sketchbook.

Conrad examines the paint cloth more carefully.
Conrad: Wait. There's something here. A small tag.
He holds it up to the light.
Conrad: Student art supplies are labeled for inventory. This tag has a number.
[signal arg="unlock_evidence inventory_tag_cloth_c3"]
Mark: And if we can match that number to Victor's assigned supplies...
Conrad: Then we have physical evidence placing his materials at the crime scene.
Conrad: Let's check the inventory log. Ms. Reyes keeps records of everything.

"Ms Reyes": An inventory number? Yes, we track all school-provided supplies.
"Ms Reyes": Let me check the log.
She pulls out a thick binder and flips through pages.
"Ms Reyes": The number you mentioned... that corresponds to supplies assigned to cabinet 14.
Conrad: Whose cabinet is that?
"Ms Reyes" looks up, her face troubled.
"Ms Reyes": Victor Lim.
Conrad: Thank you, Ms. Reyes.

Mark: So we have it. The cloth at the scene came from Victor's supplies.
