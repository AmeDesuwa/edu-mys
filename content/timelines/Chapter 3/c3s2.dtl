The art room is filled with half-finished canvases and clay-dusted tables.
Ms. Reyes, the art teacher, sorts through supplies with trembling hands.

"Ms Reyes": This is devastating. Art Week was supposed to celebrate our students' creativity.
"Ms Reyes": Now all anyone will remember is the destruction.
Conrad: Ms. Reyes, I'm trying to find out who did this. Can you help me understand the situation?
"Ms Reyes" sets down the brushes she was holding.
"Ms Reyes": I'll tell you what I know. Ask me anything.
Conrad: Tell me about Mia's sculpture. Why was it the centerpiece?
"Ms Reyes": Because it was extraordinary. Mia poured her heart into that piece.
"Ms Reyes": She won the regional competition last month. The judges called it "emotionally transcendent."
"Ms Reyes": For a high school student to create something so moving... it's rare.
Conrad: Did anyone have a problem with Mia winning?
"Ms Reyes" hesitates, glancing toward the door.
"Ms Reyes": Art is competitive. There's always... tension when one student excels.
Conrad: Anyone specific?
"Ms Reyes": Victor Lim. He's incredibly talented. Technically, he might even be better than Mia.
"Ms Reyes": But his work lacks... soul. It's precise but cold.
"Ms Reyes": He entered the same competition. Didn't even place.
Conrad: How did he take it?
"Ms Reyes": He didn't say much. But I've seen him staring at Mia's sculpture.
"Ms Reyes": Not with admiration. With something darker.
Conrad: Where can I find Victor?
"Ms Reyes": He should be in the courtyard, setting up his display. He insisted on being part of Art Week despite... well.
Conrad: Despite what?
"Ms Reyes": His sculpture wasn't selected for the main exhibit. The committee felt it was technically impressive but lacked emotional resonance.
"Ms Reyes": He took it personally.
Conrad: Thank you, Ms. Reyes. This helps.

Mark: So we have a jealous rival who got rejected from the exhibit?
Conrad: Motive and opportunity. But we need more than that.
Conrad: Let's talk to Victor.

Victor stands near a small display at the edge of the courtyard, arms crossed.
His sculpture - a geometric abstract piece - sits ignored while crowds gather near the crime scene.

Victor's eyes narrow as Conrad approaches.
Victor: Let me guess. You're here to accuse me.
Conrad: I'm here to ask questions. Everyone is a potential witness.
Victor: Witness? I wasn't anywhere near the courtyard last night.
Conrad: I didn't mention when it happened.
Victor's jaw tightens.
Victor: It's obvious. The sculpture was fine yesterday. Destroyed this morning. Basic logic.
Conrad: You seem upset.
Victor: Of course I'm upset. Everyone's making this about Mia. "Poor Mia, her beautiful sculpture."
Victor: No one even looks at my work. No one ever does.
Conrad: Your sculpture is technically impressive.
Victor scoffs.
Victor: "Technically impressive." That's what they always say. Right before they give the award to someone else.
Victor: Do you know how many hours I practice? How many techniques I've mastered?
Victor: And Mia just... feels her way through it. No discipline. No rigor.
Victor: Yet everyone loves her work and ignores mine.
Conrad: That sounds frustrating.
Victor: Frustrating doesn't begin to cover it.
Victor uncrosses his arms, stepping closer.
Victor: But I didn't destroy her sculpture. I'm not a criminal.
Victor: Besides, I was home all night. Ask my parents.
Conrad: We might do that.
Victor: You do that.
Victor turns back to his ignored display.
Victor: Now leave me alone. Some of us have actual art to show.

Mark: He's bitter. Really bitter.
Conrad: Bitter enough to destroy Mia's sculpture?
Mark: He says he was home, but that alibi needs verification.
Conrad: Let's gather more evidence before we confront anyone.
Mark: What are you thinking?
Conrad: The paint-stained cloth. If we can match it to Victor's supplies...
Conrad: And the note. The handwriting might tell us something.

Conrad returns to where he found Mia.
She's sitting on a bench, staring at the spot where her sculpture once stood.

Conrad: Mia, can I ask you a few more questions?
Mia: Of course. Anything to help find who did this.
Conrad: Did you have any conflicts with other students? Anyone who might wish you harm?
Mia thinks carefully.
Mia: I try to get along with everyone. I don't... I don't understand competition.
Mia: Art isn't about winning. It's about expressing what's inside you.
Conrad: What about Victor Lim?
Mia's expression softens with sadness.
Mia: Victor is talented. Really talented.
Mia: But he's always so focused on being better than everyone else.
Mia: He once told me I "got lucky" with my regional win. That the judges didn't understand "real" technique.
Conrad: How did that make you feel?
Mia: Sad. Not for me. For him.
Mia: He works so hard, but he's working for the wrong reasons.
Mia: Art should come from love, not from wanting to be superior.
Conrad: Do you think Victor could have done this?
Mia hesitates.
Mia: I... I don't want to accuse anyone. But the note...
Mia: "Not everyone deserves to shine." That sounds like something someone says when they feel overlooked.
Mia: Victor always felt overlooked.
Conrad: Thank you, Mia. I'm going to find the truth.

"Diwata Laya" materializes beside Conrad, her form shimmering.
"Diwata Laya": Conrad. May I see the note?
Conrad passes it to her discretely.
"Diwata Laya" holds the paper gently, closing her eyes.
"Diwata Laya": I sense... pain. Deep, festering pain.
"Diwata Laya": The person who wrote this has been hurting for a long time.
"Diwata Laya": They didn't destroy that sculpture out of hate. They destroyed it out of desperation.
"Diwata Laya": They believed this was the only way anyone would see them.
Conrad: That's tragic.
"Diwata Laya": It is. But tragedy does not excuse the harm they caused.
"Diwata Laya": Find them, Conrad. Not to punish, but to understand.

	Conrad: No. Ms. Reyes was genuinely distressed about the damage.
	Conrad: She has no motive to destroy her own student's work. And she pointed us toward Victor herself.
	Conrad: If she wanted to protect him, she wouldn't have mentioned his resentment.

	set {chapter3_score} -= 5
	Conrad: The note says "Not everyone deserves to shine." That's personal.
	Conrad: An outsider wouldn't care about who "deserves" recognition at our school.
	Conrad: This was done by someone who feels overlooked. Someone inside.

- Victor. He has motive, knowledge, and the emotional connection to this crime.

	Conrad: Victor resents Mia's success. He was rejected from the exhibit.
	Conrad: He has access to the school and knows where the sculpture was displayed.
	Conrad: And the note reflects exactly what he's been expressing: feeling invisible while Mia shines.
Mark: So what do we do?
Conrad: We need hard evidence. The paint cloth, the note's handwriting, anything that proves Victor was there.
Conrad: Let's check the art room storage.
