Conrad walks through the hallway toward the faculty room.

Conrad: The janitor said the leak started yesterday, but no one noticed until this morning...
Conrad: If someone sabotaged it, they would've needed access after hours. But how?

A shimmering figure appears beside Conrad - visible only to him. This is Diwata Laya, a spirit bound to Conrad. Only he can see and hear her.
"Diwata Laya": [i][color=#9999ff]You seem troubled, Conrad. Your thoughts are scattered.[/color][/i]
"Conrad (Thinking)": Laya! I know the timeline is suspicious, but I don't know what to look for when I get to the faculty room.
"Diwata Laya": [i][color=#9999ff]I may be able to guide you... but first, prove your mind is focused enough to receive my insight.[/color][/i]
"Conrad (Thinking)": Fine. Test me.
[signal arg="start_minigame focus_test"]
"Diwata Laya": [i][color=#9999ff]Good. Your mind is clear. Now listen carefully.[/color][/i]
"Diwata Laya": [i][color=#9999ff]When you reach that room, do not just look at what was damaged. Look for what was left behind.[/color][/i]
"Diwata Laya": [i][color=#9999ff]Saboteurs are careless. They leave traces - not just of their actions, but of their presence.[/color][/i]
"Conrad (Thinking)": So I should search for physical evidence... something the culprit might have dropped or left behind.
"Diwata Laya": [i][color=#9999ff]Precisely. And speak with those in authority. They may have information they don't realize is important.[/color][/i]
"Conrad (Thinking)": Got it. The principal should be there. I'll talk to him and examine the scene myself.
