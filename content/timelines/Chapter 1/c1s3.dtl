Conrad enters the school faculty room. He sees that some teachers and student are doing schoolwork.
He sees the Principal and approaches him.

Conrad: Excuse me Principal Alan, do you have time to talk sir?
Principal: Classes are over, you should head home as soon as possible to stay out of trouble. However, students do have a right to ask their principal for advice.
Principal: Fine, go ahead and ask me anything.
Conrad: I'm just curious about the ruined exam papers. Is it true that they ruined to the point that they can't be graded?
Principal: Yes, it's true. All of the exam papers of Grade 12-A are wet. Thankfully the exam papers of Grade 12-B  weren't included.
Conrad: Can I take a look at the place where it happened sir?
Principal: It was already cleaned up earlier, here take a look. I took a photo of the mess earlier since the store where the leaking air conditioner was bought didn't believe that it was leaking.

Conrad (none): (Hmmm...... the water seems to be a bit too much from only a natural leak. The amount of water looks more like from a pipe instead of a leak.

What's wrong with this picture?
- The airconditioning unit looks old so it was only natural that it leaked
	jump Deduction
- The tube is cut, but the door was locked. How did they get in?
	jump After
- The tube where the leak is looks like it was bitten by an animal.
	jump Deduction
label After
Conrad: Sir Alan, the tube was definitely cut. But there's no sign of forced entry on the door.
Principal: That is impossible. Only the staff have keys to this room.

Conrad: Unless someone stole a key... or was given one.
Principal: That implies deliberate sabotage from someone with access. Why would someone do this?
Conrad: Considering that this incident made it so that the exam papers cannot be graded. The motive should be to cause a retake.
Principal: And because they already took the exam, even though the exam questions will be altered. The exam will be much easier since we have a deadline to follow so we cant rigorously alter the exam questions.
Conrad: Correct Sir
Principal: As an educator this is unacceptable, but I can't really investigate this myself since the 3rd grading is ending and I have too much work to finish.
Conrad: Can I investigate this in your stead sir?
Principal: Are you sure? Is all your school work already done? If not then I can't let you ignore your responsibilities while you investigate this.
Conrad: All my exams are already done and I have already passed all my requirements.
Principal: Fine, you investigate this matter. I'll inform the staff and teachers to cooperate.
Conrad: Leave it to me sir.
Principal: Good.
Conrad: (My phone is buzzing. It's a message from Mark.)

Conrad: Sir, does this room have a dedicated Wi-Fi router?
join Principal right
Principal: Yes, since the general wifi set up for the school is weak in the faculty room. A dedicated wifi network and a router for staff use is installed here.
Principal: While it may be for staff use, it is also intended for students to use it as well. Why?
Conrad: My phone just auto-connected to it. If the culprit was here, their phone might have done the same. Can we check the connection logs?
Principal: All the phones of the students should have access since it the password was provided in the orientation and is available to see at the Bulletin Board.
Principal: That is a clever idea. Let me check the admin panel...

Principal: Interesting. Two devices connected to the "Faculty_Wifi" network yesterday evening.
Principal: One connected at 8\:00 PM, device name "Galaxy_A52". The other at 9\:00 PM, device name "Redmi_Note_10".
Conrad: Galaxy A52 and Redmi Note 10... Those are specific models.
Conrad: I need to confirm who owns these.

Conrad: (Texts Mark) "Hey, do you know anyone in 12-A who uses a Galaxy A52 or a Redmi Note 10?"
Conrad: (Mark replies) "I'm not sure about the specific models. But Alice, the class monitor, collects our phones during exams. She would know."
Conrad: (Mark replies) "She's usually at the lockers this time."
Conrad: Thanks, Sir. I have a lead to follow up on.

Conrad leaves the room and is walking in the hallway
join Conrad (half) left
Conrad: (Of course the students of 12-A are definitely suspects but it's gonna take a long time to question them all individually, which makes it impossible to catch them before the grades are permanently recorded.)
Conrad: (It would also alert the perp which makes the investigation harder.)
Conrad: (Also it wouldn't be impossible for this to be coordinated by multiple people.)
Conrad: Ughhhh... This is so hard. Why did I think that I could do this.
Conrad walks in the hallway to leave the building to go to the school gate

Alice: Yes? What is it, Conrad?
Conrad: Mark said you know a lot about our classmates' phones since you collect them. Do you know anyone who uses a Galaxy A52 or a Redmi Note 10?
Alice: Hmm... let me think.
Alice: Oh, right. Ben has a Galaxy A52. He's always bragging about the camera.
Alice: And Greg has a Redmi Note 10. I remember the red case.
Conrad: Thanks, Alice. That helps a lot.

Conrad: (So the devices in the logs belong to Ben and Greg. They were in the faculty room last night.)
Conrad: (I have the suspects. Now I just need to prove it.)
join "Diwata Laya" (Half_mirror) right
"Diwata Laya": It's alright you can do this.
Conrad: Looks like you're awake. I've narrowed it down to two students.
"Diwata Laya": Last time, it took me too much energy so I had to rest. I've recovered mostly but the help I can give is limited.
Conrad: This case is kinda rough though, I really need your help.
"Diwata Laya": I've seen what's been happening even though I've been resting for a while. Don't worry too much, do what you can and we'll see how I can help. Since I've recovered quite a bit, my ability to compel people to tell the truth or cooperate has come back to me.
Conrad: Well that's gonna be super helpful.
Diwata Laya is your helper! She is very intelligent and can help you quite a lot. However she is very limited as she is not allowed to interact much with the human world, so she is limited in the help she can give.
Conrad: Great, I'll tell Mark what we've learned later. Help me brainstorm once we get home later.
"Diwata Laya": Ok.
