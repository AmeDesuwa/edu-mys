The time is now 5\:30. Today's classes are over. Instead of going home, Conrad and Mark stay in the classroom to talk.

Conrad: Finally, classes are over. Dude, let's go find that Janitor!
Mark: I can't man, mom told me to go home as soon as possible. My mom and I got invited to celebrate my cousin's birthday. You know how my mom is.
Conrad: Alright, fine. We can just talk through messages just in case I need you for something. You better respond as soon as you can.

Conrad immediately went to the classroom
his chest tightening with every step. When he reached the door, he froze.

Conrad: (Okay, Conrad, get it together)
Conrad: What is the right way to ask this? How do I approach him without sounding guilty?

Conrad: Good afternoon, sir. I was hoping you could help me. I’m looking for something I lost in this room—have you come across anything unusual while you were sweeping?
The Janitor brings in his cleaning equipment in the room.
"Janitor Fred": No young man, what do you need from me?
Conrad: I noticed earlier today that there seems to be a problem with the exam papers? Do you know what that's about?
"Janitor Fred": I overheard them at the faculty earlier panicking about how the exam papers are ruined because they got wet. One air conditioning unit in the faculty room started leaking yesterday. It was noticed by the English teacher this morning.
Conrad: Huh, those looked pretty new from what I can remember.
"Janitor Fred": That is why the principal is so mad. He called the store where the air conditioner was bought to complain. The store is sending a repair guy.
Conrad: Do you know when the repair guy will arrive?
"Janitor Fred": He'll probably arrive anytime now. I heard the principal say that it will probably be after classes are done for the day.
Conrad: Thanks for answering my questions.
"Janitor Fred": No problem kid.

Janitor leaves the room after checking how dirty it is, but does not clean the room yet.
Conrad: Hmmm, nothing is really suspicious from what I have gathered so far.
