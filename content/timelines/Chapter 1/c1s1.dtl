Outside, near the student bulletin, Conrad Santos listened quietly.\
Unlike most of his classmates who found it exciting gossip, he felt something strange — a [b][wave]pull[/wave][/b].
update Conrad (half)
Mysteries had always fascinated him, especially since he and his best friends Eli Vergara and Hannah Lim \
accidentally solved the missing ID case last semester.

Mark: Hey Conrad, Don't tell me you want to investigate this?
Conrad: You know me too well.
Mark: Are you sure you wanna do this?
Conrad: YESS, now help me.
Mark: Alright, but where do we start?
Conrad: First we need to find potential witnesses.
Mark: Since the incident took place after school hours, we should focus first on the school staff since they should be the last people to leave the school.
Conrad: Good idea, but it would take a lot of time to track and question all of the school staff. It would be impractical to ask them all.

Conrad: Hmmmm. Who among the school employees would be most likely to have useful information?
- Janitor
	Conrad: Oh, a Janitor!
	Mark: Good thinking bro. Since their job description doesn't really include security, they don't need to make a report.
	Conrad: Let's ask the Janitor after classes. Last time I checked there are 3 janitors, and they have their own areas. We just need to find the one assigned to the faculty room.
