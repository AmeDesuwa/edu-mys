Conrad: Ria, we need to ask you something else. Has anything strange happened recently? Anything you haven't told us?
Ria hesitates, looking down at her hands.
Ria: I... there is something.
Mark: What is it?
Ria: I got a note in my locker. A few days ago.
Conrad: What kind of note?
Ria: (voice shaking) It said... "I know what you did with last year's fund. Resign or I'll expose you."
Mark: Someone was threatening you? Why didn't you tell anyone?
Ria: I was scared! I thought it would make me look more guilty.
Conrad: What did you do with last year's fund, Ria?
Ria: Nothing! I mean... I made a mistake once.
Ria: I left the money box unlocked overnight. But nothing was taken!
Ria: I fixed it the next morning. I thought no one knew.
Conrad: Someone knew. And they used it against you.
Conrad: Do you still have the note?
Ria: (pulls out a folded paper) Here. I've been carrying it around, too afraid to show anyone.
Conrad takes the note and examines it carefully.
Conrad: This handwriting is careful. Deliberate. Not written in anger.
Mark: So whoever wrote this planned it out.
Conrad: Exactly. This wasn't a random threat. It was calculated.

"Diwata Laya": I sense something. Let me look closer at this note.
"Diwata Laya" holds the note gently.
"Diwata Laya": The person who wrote this... they wanted control. They wanted chaos, but on their terms.
Conrad: I need to see Ryan's budget proposal. The one he was printing yesterday.
Mark: You think Ryan wrote this?
Conrad: I think we need to compare the handwriting. Let's check the printer's reject tray.
