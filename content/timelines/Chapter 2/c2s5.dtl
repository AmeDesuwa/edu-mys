The sports equipment storage room is dim and dusty. Basketball hoops lean against walls, and volleyball nets hang from hooks.

Mark: This place is a mess. Where would someone hide money in here?
Conrad: Somewhere out of sight. Behind equipment that hasn't been used in a while.
Conrad knocks firmly on the partially open door.
Conrad: Ryan, we know you're in here. We need to talk.
Silence. Then the sound of something being set down.
The door opens wider. Ryan stands inside, his expression caught between surprise and defiance.

Ryan: What are you two doing here? This storage is off-limits to non-committee members.
Conrad: We found something interesting in the computer lab.
Ryan's jaw tightens almost imperceptibly.
Ryan: The computer lab is public. Whatever you found has nothing to do with me.
Conrad: Really? Then explain this.
Conrad holds up the crumpled budget proposal draft.
Conrad: Your handwriting. Your margin notes.
Conrad: "If they won't listen, I'll have to make them see reason."
Ryan waves his hand dismissively.
Ryan: So what? I write notes to myself all the time.
Conrad pulls out the second piece of paper - the threatening note.
Conrad: This note was left in Ria's locker three days ago.
Conrad: "I know what you did with last year's fund. Resign or I'll expose you."
Ryan's face goes pale.
Conrad: The handwriting is identical, Ryan. Same loops on the 'e'. Same sharp angles on the 'k'.
Conrad: You wrote this threat. You knew about Ria's mistake because you've been watching the council.
Conrad: Waiting for your chance.
Ryan: That... that doesn't prove anything.
Conrad: The printer logs show you stopped printing for over an hour yesterday evening.
Conrad: During that exact time, Ms. Santos left the faculty room for coffee.
Conrad: You saw her leave. You took the key from her unlocked drawer. You opened the council room.
Conrad: And you took the money.
Ryan stands frozen, his eyes darting around the room.
Ryan: I...
Conrad: Where's the money, Ryan?
Ryan's shoulders slump. The defiance drains from his face.
His voice comes out quiet, defeated.
Ryan: Behind the equipment racks. In a gym bag.

Mark moves past Ryan and searches behind the dusty equipment.
Mark pulls out a faded blue gym bag and unzips it.
Mark: Twenty thousand pesos. It's all here.
Desperation floods Ryan's voice.
Ryan: I wasn't stealing it! I was going to return it!
Conrad: Then why take it at all?
Ryan: I was going to "discover" it in a few days. Show everyone how easy it was to take.
Ryan: The council is careless! Ria left the box unlocked before. Ms. Santos forgets her drawer constantly.
Ryan: Someone had to prove that we need better systems!
Conrad: By framing Ria? By making her cry? By letting everyone call her a thief?
Ryan flinches at Conrad's words.
Ryan: I... I didn't think about it that way. I just wanted them to listen to me.
Ryan: Nobody ever listens. They just smile and vote no. Over and over.
Ryan: I thought if something bad happened, they'd finally pay attention.
Conrad: There are better ways to be heard, Ryan.
Conrad: You could have talked to teachers. Gone to the principal. Organized students who agreed with you.
Conrad: Instead, you chose to hurt someone innocent. Someone who was already scared and alone.
Ryan's voice breaks.
Ryan: I know. I know that now.
Ryan: When I saw Ria crying this morning... I almost told the truth right there.
Ryan: But I was too scared. Too proud.
Conrad: This wasn't leadership. This was manipulation.
Conrad: Good intentions don't excuse harmful actions.
Ryan looks at the floor, unable to meet Conrad's eyes.
Ryan: What happens now?
Conrad: That's not for us to decide. But the truth will come out.
Conrad: What you do next... that's up to you.
