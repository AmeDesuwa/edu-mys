The hallway buzzes with whispered conversations. Students cluster in groups, shooting glances toward the council room.

Conrad notices the unusual atmosphere as he walks to class.
join Mark (Mark_half) right
Mark rushes up, slightly out of breath.
Mark: Conrad! There you are. Did you hear?
Conrad: Hear what? Everyone's acting strange today.
Mark: The Student Council fund is missing. Twenty thousand pesos. Gone.
Conrad: The outreach fund? For students who need supplies?
Mark: That's the one. Ria discovered it this morning when she went to prepare the distribution list.
Mark: The lockbox was empty. Not a single peso left.

Conrad: That's a lot of money. When did this happen?
Mark: Sometime yesterday evening, after classes. The principal already called an emergency meeting.
Conrad: Who had access to the lockbox?
Mark: That's the problem. The key is kept in Ms. Santos's desk drawer in the faculty room.
Mark: Only she and the council officers know that.
Conrad frowns, processing the information.
Conrad: So it was either someone with inside knowledge, or...
Mark: Or someone who figured it out. But here's the worst part.
Mark lowers his voice.
Mark: Everyone's blaming Ria. Saying the treasurer must have taken it.
Conrad: That's a serious accusation. Is there any evidence?
Mark: Nothing solid. Just... she had access. She's the treasurer. People are connecting dots that might not exist.
Conrad: Circumstantial at best. That's not proof of guilt.
Mark: I know. But the rumors are spreading fast. I saw her crying in the bathroom earlier.
Mark: Some kids were calling her a thief to her face.
Conrad's expression hardens.
Conrad: We can't let someone be condemned without proper evidence.
Conrad: If Ria is innocent, she deserves someone to find the truth.
Mark: I was hoping you'd say that. So we're taking the case?
Conrad: We're taking the case. Who else was in the building yesterday evening?
Mark: I asked around. Ryan was in the computer lab until late. Something about printing budget documents.
Mark: And Ms. Santos was grading papers in the faculty room. She keeps the key to her drawer there.
Conrad: Anyone else?
Mark: Actually... I heard Alex was here too. Staying late for some club thing.
Conrad: Alex? The former treasurer?
Mark: Yeah. Ria replaced her last year. Some people say Alex took it personally.
Conrad considers this for a moment.
Conrad: So we have three people with potential access... and two of them have reasons to resent the current council.
Mark: Who do we talk to first?
Conrad: Ryan. The computer lab is on the way. Then Alex. Let's see what they know.
