Mark: Here are the printer logs from yesterday. Let me find Ryan's account...
Mark scrolls through the computer.
Mark: Got it. Ryan's print jobs.
Mark: 5:45 PM - Budget Proposal Draft, 12 pages.
Mark: 6:15 PM - Summary Sheet, 3 pages.
Mark: Then... nothing until 7:20 PM - Final Proposal, 8 pages.
Conrad: That's over an hour with no activity.
Mark: He said he was here the whole time. Why would he stop printing for an hour?
Conrad: Because he wasn't here. He was somewhere else.
Mark: Ms. Santos said she saw him near the stairs at 6:45. That's right after her coffee break.
Conrad: The key drawer was unlocked from 6:30 to 6:45. Ryan had fifteen minutes to take the key, open the money box, hide the cash, and return the key.
Mark: But where would he hide twenty thousand pesos?
Conrad: Somewhere no one would look. Somewhere only he has access to.
Mark: The sports equipment storage room! He's the only council member with a key.
Conrad: We can't just accuse him without solid proof. Having opportunity isn't enough.
Mark: So what do we do?
Conrad: We need evidence that directly connects him to the crime. Something he can't explain away.
Conrad: Let's go back and talk to Ria again. Maybe she noticed something she didn't think was important.
