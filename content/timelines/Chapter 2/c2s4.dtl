The computer lab is empty now. The printer sits in the corner, its paper tray half-full.

Mark heads toward the printer while Conrad examines the room.
Mark: Let me check the reject tray. If the printer was jamming, there might be messed up prints.
Mark rummages through the small compartment beneath the printer.
Mark: Here! A crumpled paper. It looks like... yeah, it's a budget proposal draft.
Conrad takes the paper and carefully smooths it out on a nearby desk.
Conrad: "Student Council Budget Reallocation Proposal - Draft 3."
Conrad: He was working on this for a while. Look at all these revision marks.
Mark: What's that in the margin?
Conrad peers closely at the handwritten notes scrawled along the edge.
He reads the margin notes aloud.
Conrad: "If they won't listen, I'll have to make them see reason."
Mark: That sounds like a threat.
Conrad: Or a declaration of intent.
Conrad pulls out the threatening note Ria gave them and places it beside the budget draft.
Conrad holds both papers side by side, comparing them carefully.
Conrad: Look at the letter 'e'. The same small loop at the bottom.
Conrad: And the 'k' in 'know' matches the 'k' in 'make'. Same sharp angle.
Mark: The handwriting matches?
Conrad: It's not just similar. It's identical. The same careful strokes. The same deliberate style.
Conrad: Ryan wrote the threatening note to Ria.
Mark: He wanted her scared and distracted.
Conrad: So when the money went missing, everyone would suspect her first.
Conrad: She was too afraid to defend herself. The perfect scapegoat.

"Diwata Laya" materializes, her expression troubled.
"Diwata Laya": Before we proceed, test your knowledge. Understanding finances will help you see Ryan's motive.
[signal arg="start_minigame budget_basics"]
"Diwata Laya": Good. Now let me see if I can sense his full intention.
"Diwata Laya" closes her eyes, her hands hovering over both papers.
For a moment, her form flickers with soft light.
"Diwata Laya": I see... a plan. Careful steps, like pieces on a game board.
"Diwata Laya": First, the threat. Create fear in the treasurer.
"Diwata Laya": Then, the theft. Take the money while suspicion falls elsewhere.
"Diwata Laya": But the plan doesn't end there...
"Diwata Laya" opens her eyes slowly.
"Diwata Laya": He was going to become the hero.
[signal arg="laya_end"]
Conrad: What do you mean?
[signal arg="laya_start"]
"Diwata Laya": I saw him in the vision. Returning the money himself. "Finding" it somewhere.
"Diwata Laya": He wanted everyone to praise his responsibility. His diligence.
"Diwata Laya": And then... propose his own budget. Show how much better he could manage things.
[signal arg="laya_end"]
leave "Diwata Laya"
Mark: He was going to "discover" the money and look like a hero?
Conrad: While proving that the council is careless and needs better systems.
Conrad: His systems. His budget. His vision.
Mark: That's... actually kind of clever. In a twisted way.
Conrad: It's manipulation disguised as righteousness.
Conrad: He convinced himself he was teaching everyone a lesson.
Conrad: But what he really did was terrorize an innocent girl and steal money meant for students who needed it.
Mark: So what now? We confront him?
Conrad: We have motive. We have opportunity. And now we have his handwriting connecting him to the threat.
Conrad: The only thing missing is the money itself.
Conrad: If we find where he hid it, the case is closed.
Mark: Where would he hide twenty thousand pesos?
Conrad: Somewhere he has access. Somewhere others don't go often.
Conrad: He mentioned printing documents yesterday. But he also has access to...
Mark: The sports equipment storage! He's on the athletic committee.
Conrad: That room is rarely used this time of year. The perfect hiding spot.
Conrad: Let's end this.
