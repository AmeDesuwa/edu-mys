A few days before the incident...
The late afternoon sun filters through the Student Council room windows, casting long shadows across the desks.

Ria sits alone, counting bills with practiced precision.
Ria: Eighteen thousand... nineteen thousand...
She places the last few bills carefully into the pile.
Ria: Twenty thousand. Perfect.
Ria's face softens into a warm smile as she looks at the money.
Ria: The outreach fund is finally complete.

She picks up a worn notebook, its pages filled with careful handwriting.
Ria: Twelve names. Twelve students who need help.
update Ria (half) center [move_time="0.3"]
Her fingers trace the list gently, pausing at certain names.
Ria: I know what it's like to be on a list like this.
Ria: Back in Grade 7, my family couldn't afford new notebooks.
Ria: I had to write on the backs of old papers. Recycled everything I could find.

Ria: The other kids noticed. They always do.
Ria: "Basurera," they called me. Garbage girl.
Ria: They said I didn't belong in this school.

Ria's expression shifts from pain to determination.
Ria: But then the student council helped me. Quietly. No announcement. No pity.
Ria: Just a bag of supplies left on my desk one morning.
Ria: That small act... it changed everything.
She places the money gently into the lockbox.
Ria: That's why I became treasurer. So I could be that person for someone else.

Ria closes the lockbox and tests the lock twice.
Ria: This money isn't just paper and ink.
Ria: It's hope. It's dignity. It's proof that someone cares.
She walks to Ms. Santos's desk and places the key in the drawer.

Ria: Next week, twelve students will know they're not alone.
Ria: Just like I learned I wasn't alone.
She gathers her bag, taking one last look at the lockbox.
Ria: Stay safe, little fund. I'm counting on you.

The room falls silent. The lockbox sits alone on the desk.

Outside the window, a figure watches from the hallway.
