The money has been returned. Ryan faces disciplinary action but is offered counseling instead of expulsion.

Mark: I almost feel bad for him. He really thought he was doing the right thing.
"Diwata Laya": Good intentions don't excuse harmful actions. But they can be the start of learning.
Conrad: Ria's name is cleared. That's what matters.
Mark: She stopped by earlier. She wanted to thank us but was too shy.
Mark: She said she'll be more careful with the money from now on. And she'll speak up if something feels wrong.
Conrad: That's all we can ask for.
Conrad notices something on the table - a small card that wasn't there before.
Conrad: What's this?
Conrad picks it up and reads.
Conrad: "Lesson 2: Responsibility."
Conrad: "True responsibility isn't about pointing out others' failures."
Conrad: "It's about building trust, even when no one is watching."
Conrad: "The one who manipulates in the name of righteousness is still a manipulator."
Conrad: "Well done, detectives. The chain continues."
Conrad: "Signed... B.C."
"Diwata Laya": B.C. again. Just like the note from the first case.
Mark: Are they watching us? How do these notes keep appearing?
Conrad: Whoever B.C. is, they're not just leaving clues. They're teaching us something.
"Diwata Laya": And the chain continues. There will be more mysteries.
Conrad: Then we'll be ready.
Conrad stares at the note, deep in thought.
Conrad: Every case, we learn something new. About others. About ourselves.
Conrad: Responsibility isn't just about holding something safe.
Conrad: It's about what you do when no one else is looking.
Mark: Deep thoughts, Conrad.
Conrad: Just thinking out loud.
Conrad: Come on. Let's go get some lunch. I'm starving.
"Diwata Laya": Some things never change.
They laugh as they leave the room together.
