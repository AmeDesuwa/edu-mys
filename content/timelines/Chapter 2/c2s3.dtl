The Student Council room feels different now. The lockbox sits empty on the desk, a silent accusation.

Ria looks smaller than before, her shoulders hunched. Her eyes are red from crying.
Mark: Ria, are you okay?
Her voice is barely above a whisper.
Ria: Everyone thinks I did it. I can hear them whispering.
Conrad: We don't think that. We're trying to find out what really happened.
Ria looks up, a flicker of hope in her eyes.
Ria: You... you believe me?
Conrad: I believe in evidence. And right now, there's no evidence against you.
Conrad: But I need to ask you some questions. Is there anything you haven't told anyone?
Ria's hands tremble slightly. She looks down at the floor.
Ria: I... there is something.
Mark: What is it?
Ria takes a shaky breath.
Ria: A few days ago, I found a note in my locker.
Conrad: What kind of note?
Ria's voice breaks.
Ria: A threat.
She reaches into her pocket and pulls out a folded piece of paper.
Ria: It said... "I know what you did with last year's fund. Resign or I'll expose you."
Mark: Someone was threatening you? Why didn't you tell anyone?
Tears begin to form in Ria's eyes.
Ria: I was scared! I thought if I told someone, it would make me look guilty.
Ria: Like I had something to hide. So I just... kept it to myself.
Conrad: What did you do with last year's fund, Ria?
Ria: Nothing! I mean... I made a mistake once.
Ria: I was rushing to get home for my grandmother's birthday. I forgot to lock the money box overnight.
Ria: But nothing was taken! I checked first thing the next morning.
Ria: I fixed it immediately. I thought no one knew.
Conrad: Someone knew. And they used it against you.
Conrad reaches out his hand.
Conrad: May I see the note?
Ria hands it over, her hand shaking.
Conrad studies the paper carefully, holding it up to the light.
Conrad: The handwriting is careful. Each letter formed with precision.
Conrad: This wasn't written in anger or haste. Someone planned this message.
Mark: So whoever wrote this had time to think it through.
Conrad: More than that. They knew about Ria's mistake from last year.
Conrad: This information wasn't public. Only someone watching closely would know.

"Diwata Laya" appears beside Conrad, her form shimmering faintly.
"Diwata Laya": There is more to this note than paper and ink.
"Diwata Laya": May I examine it?
Conrad passes the note to the diwata.
"Diwata Laya" holds the note gently, closing her eyes.
"Diwata Laya": I sense... calculation. Cold purpose behind these words.
"Diwata Laya": The person who wrote this... they wanted control. Not just revenge.
"Diwata Laya": They wanted Ria afraid. Distracted. Unable to defend herself.
"Diwata Laya" opens her eyes.
"Diwata Laya": This threat was the first step in a larger plan.
"Diwata Laya": Someone set Ria up to take the blame.

Conrad: Careful handwriting. Calculated timing. Knowledge of Ria's past mistake. Who could have written this?
- Maybe Ria wrote it herself to deflect suspicion. [if {c2s3_ria_tried} == false]

	Conrad: No. Look at her. She's genuinely terrified.

	set {chapter2_score} -= 5
	Conrad: Alex knew about the mistake, and she's clearly bitter about losing her position.
	Conrad: But this note isn't about proving she was better. It's about forcing Ria out.
	Conrad: Alex wants recognition, not destruction. And the threat mentions "exposing" Ria...
	Conrad: But if Alex wanted to expose Ria, she could have done it publicly. Why threaten first?
	Conrad: This feels more like manipulation toward a specific goal. That's not Alex's style.

- Ryan. He had motive, and this fits his personality.
	set {chapter2_score} += 10
	[signal arg="correct_choice"]
	Conrad: Ryan was frustrated that his budget proposals kept getting rejected.
	Conrad: If he wanted to force change in the council, discrediting the treasurer would be a calculated first step.
	Conrad: He could observe council operations. He would notice Ria's habits.

[signal arg="show_level_up"]
Mark: But how do we prove Ryan wrote it?
Conrad: I need to see something written in Ryan's own hand. His budget proposal.
Conrad: He said the printer was jamming yesterday. Maybe there's a rejected copy somewhere.
Mark: The printer reject tray in the computer lab.
Conrad: Exactly. Let's check it. If the handwriting matches...
Hope flickers in Ria's eyes.
Ria: You really think you can prove I didn't do it?
Conrad: I don't think. I investigate. And right now, the evidence is pointing away from you.
