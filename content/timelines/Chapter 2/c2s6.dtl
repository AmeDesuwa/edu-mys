The Student Council room looks different now. Afternoon light streams through the windows, warm and hopeful.

Mark: I heard Ryan turned himself in to the principal this morning.
Conrad: He did the right thing. Eventually.
Mark: What's going to happen to him?
Conrad: The principal decided on counseling instead of expulsion. And community service.
Conrad: He'll be helping organize the supply distribution for the students Ria was trying to help.
Mark: That's... actually fitting. Make him understand what he almost destroyed.
Conrad: Twenty thousand pesos. Twelve students who needed help.
Conrad: He was so focused on being right that he forgot about the people who would get hurt.
Mark: Ria stopped by earlier, by the way.
Conrad: I heard. How is she?
Mark: Better. She wanted to thank us but was too nervous to find you herself.
Mark: She said she'll be more careful with the money from now on. Double-check everything.
Mark: And she'll speak up if something feels wrong. No more keeping secrets out of fear.
Conrad: That's all we can ask for.
The room falls quiet. Conrad notices something on the table that wasn't there before.
A small, elegant card rests on the surface, its edges crisp and clean.
Conrad: What's this?
Conrad picks it up, examining it with curiosity.
Mark: Another one? Like after the last case?
Conrad reads the card aloud.
Conrad: "Lesson 2: Responsibility."
Conrad: "True responsibility isn't about pointing out others' failures."
Conrad: "It's about building trust, even when no one is watching."
Mark: That's... actually pretty deep.
He continues reading.
Conrad: "The one who manipulates in the name of righteousness is still a manipulator."
Conrad: "Well done, detectives. The chain continues."
Conrad: "Signed... B.C."
Mark: B.C. again. Just like the note from the first case.
Mark: Who is this person? How do they keep leaving these notes?

"Diwata Laya" appears, studying the card with ancient eyes.
"Diwata Laya": B.C. The same presence I sensed before.
"Diwata Laya": They are watching your progress. Testing you, perhaps.
"Diwata Laya": "The chain continues." There will be more mysteries to solve.
Conrad: Do you know who B.C. is?
"Diwata Laya" shakes her head slowly.
"Diwata Laya": Even I cannot see them clearly. They move between moments, leaving only traces.
"Diwata Laya": But I sense no malice. Only... purpose. A lesson being taught, across time.

leave "Diwata Laya"
Mark: So we have a mysterious teacher watching us solve crimes.
Mark: That's not creepy at all.
Conrad: Whoever B.C. is, they're not just leaving clues. They're guiding us toward something.
Conrad: Each case teaches us a lesson. Each lesson builds on the last.
Mark: First lesson was about truth. This one was about responsibility.
Mark: I wonder what's next.

Conrad: We'll find out when we're meant to.
Conrad stares at the note, deep in thought.
Conrad: Every case, we learn something new. About others. About ourselves.
Conrad: Ryan thought he was being responsible. Protecting the school from carelessness.
Conrad: But real responsibility isn't about controlling others or proving them wrong.
Mark: It's about what you do when no one else is looking.
Conrad nods.
Conrad: Ria checked that lockbox every day. Counted every peso. Not because anyone was watching.
Conrad: Because she remembered what it felt like to need help. And she wanted to be there for others.
Mark: That's the real difference, isn't it?
Mark: Ryan wanted to be seen as responsible. Ria just... was.
Conrad: Exactly.
Mark tries to lighten the mood.
Mark: Deep thoughts, Conrad. You're getting philosophical on me.
Conrad: Just thinking out loud.
A comfortable silence settles between them.
Conrad: Come on. Let's go get some lunch. I'm starving.
Mark: Some things never change.
They share a laugh as they head toward the door.
Conrad pauses at the door.
Conrad: Hey, Mark?
Mark: Yeah?
Conrad: Thanks for believing in me. For taking these cases seriously.
Mark grins.
Mark: What are partners for?
Conrad: Partners. I like the sound of that.
They leave the room together, their footsteps echoing down the hallway.
leave Conrad
leave Mark
The B.C. card remains on the table, catching the last rays of afternoon sunlight.
The chain continues.
