[EVENT: show_title_card 2]


[SCENE: COUNCIL_ROOM]

[set {chapter2_score} = 0]

A few days before the incident...

The late afternoon sun filters through the Student Council room windows, casting long shadows across the desks.
[Ria enters]

Ria sits alone, counting bills with practiced precision.

Ria: Eighteen thousand... nineteen thousand...

She places the last few bills carefully into the pile.

Ria: Twenty thousand. Perfect.

Ria's face softens into a warm smile as she looks at the money.

Ria: The outreach fund is finally complete.

update Ria (half) left 

She picks up a worn notebook, its pages filled with careful handwriting.

Ria: Twelve names. Twelve students who need help.

update Ria (half) center 

Her fingers trace the list gently, pausing at certain names.

Ria: I know what it's like to be on a list like this.

Ria: Back in Grade 7, my family couldn't afford new notebooks.

Ria: I had to write on the backs of old papers. Recycled everything I could find.

update Ria (half) right 

Ria: The other kids noticed. They always do.

Ria: "Basurera," they called me. Garbage girl.

Ria: They said I didn't belong in this school.

update Ria (half) center 

Ria's expression shifts from pain to determination.

Ria: But then the student council helped me. Quietly. No announcement. No pity.

Ria: Just a bag of supplies left on my desk one morning.

Ria: That small act... it changed everything.

She places the money gently into the lockbox.

Ria: That's why I became treasurer. So I could be that person for someone else.

update Ria (half) left 

Ria closes the lockbox and tests the lock twice.

Ria: This money isn't just paper and ink.

Ria: It's hope. It's dignity. It's proof that someone cares.

She walks to Ms. Santos's desk and places the key in the drawer.

update Ria (half) center 

Ria: Next week, twelve students will know they're not alone.

Ria: Just like I learned I wasn't alone.

She gathers her bag, taking one last look at the lockbox.

Ria: Stay safe, little fund. I'm counting on you.
[Ria leaves]

The room falls silent. The lockbox sits alone on the desk.

Outside the window, a figure watches from the hallway.

[SCENE: HALLWAY]
