The next day. The school courtyard is busy with students moving between classes.

join Mark (Mark_half) right
Conrad and Mark walk together, their conversation easy and comfortable.
Mark: So B.C. is the Principal. The mysterious guide was literally running the school.
Mark: Hidden in plain sight the whole time.
Conrad: The best hiding place often is. No one suspects the obvious.
Mark: Do you think anyone else knows? About B.C.?
Conrad: Probably not. The Principal keeps their dual role separate for good reason.
Conrad: As Principal, they handle immediate problems. As B.C., they plant seeds for long-term growth.
Conrad: Both roles are necessary. Both serve students.
Mark: And now you're part of that. Helping students learn and grow.
Conrad: In my own way, yes.
They stop near a bench where a student sits alone, looking troubled.
Mark: That's Ben. From the exam case. He looks stressed.
Conrad: He does. Should I talk to him?
Mark: That's your call. You're the guide now, remember?
Conrad considers, then approaches gently.
join Ben (half) center
Conrad: Hey, Ben. You okay?
Ben looks up, surprised but relieved.
Ben: Conrad. Actually... I've been struggling with something.
Ben: My friend asked me to cover for him during practice. Said he needs to skip for something important.
Ben: But I know the coach will ask me directly if he was there. And I don't want to lie.
Conrad: So you're torn between helping your friend and being honest.
Ben: Exactly. What would you do?
Conrad pauses. Old Conrad might have told him the answer.
New Conrad understands better.
Conrad: I can't make that choice for you, Ben. It's yours to make.
Conrad: But I can help you think through it.
Conrad: What happens if you lie for him? What happens if you refuse?
Conrad: What values matter most to you? Loyalty? Honesty?
Ben thinks carefully.
Ben: I... I think I need to tell him I can't lie for him. But I can help him figure out another way.
Ben: Maybe we can talk to the coach together, explain why he needs to miss practice.
Conrad: That sounds like a solution that respects both honesty and friendship.
Ben: Thanks, Conrad. I just needed to talk it through.
Ben walks away, looking more confident.
leave Ben
Mark: You did it. You didn't solve his problem for him.
Mark: You helped him solve it himself.
Conrad: That's the lesson B.C. taught me. People grow when they make their own choices.
Conrad: I can guide. I can ask questions. But the choice is theirs.
join Alice (half) center
Alice approaches, looking curious.
Alice: Conrad, I heard you helped solve four major cases this year.
Alice: The exam theft, the missing fund, the broken sculpture, and the journal incident.
Alice: How did you do it? What's your secret?
Conrad: No secret. Just observation, evidence, and trying to understand people.
Conrad: Every mystery is really about understanding why people make the choices they do.
Alice: So you're like... a detective psychologist?
Conrad: Maybe. Or maybe just someone trying to help.
Alice: Could you teach me? How to observe like you do?
Conrad considers. B.C. taught him through experience, not lectures.
Conrad: I can't teach you directly. But I can suggest something.
Conrad: Pay attention. Really look at what's around you. Listen when people speak.
Conrad: Try to understand motivations, not just actions.
Conrad: And when you see someone struggling, ask yourself: What are they really afraid of? What do they really need?
Alice: That's... simpler than I expected. But harder to actually do.
Conrad: Exactly. The best lessons are like that.
Alice: Thanks, Conrad. I'll try.
leave Alice
leave Mark
Conrad stands alone for a moment, watching students move through the courtyard.
Each one carrying their own struggles, making their own choices.

Conrad returns to his locker, pulling out his notebook.
Inside are the five B.C. cards, carefully preserved.
Truth. Responsibility. Creativity. Wisdom. Choice.
join Conrad (half) center
Conrad: Five lessons. Five mysteries. Five transformations.
He pulls out a blank cream-colored card he prepared himself.
Conrad carefully writes on it in precise handwriting, echoing B.C.'s style.
Conrad: "To future students: Look beneath the surface. Understand before judging. Guide without controlling."
Conrad: "The chain continues, but it is yours to shape. - C"
He places his own card with B.C.'s cards.
Conrad: The student has become the teacher. The chain transforms.

Conrad: But the journey doesn't end. It never ends.
Conrad: There will always be mysteries. Always people needing help.
Conrad: And I'll be there. Not as B.C. was - patient and hidden.
Conrad: But as myself. Conrad. A student who learned to guide others.

His own wisdom.
His own compassion.
