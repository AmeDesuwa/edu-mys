Conrad and Mark enter the auditorium quietly.
A figure stands on the stage, examining the arrangement Conrad created.

The figure turns slowly.
It's the Principal.

But something is different. Their expression is softer, more contemplative.
In their hand, they hold Conrad's card.
Principal: "Will you teach me one more lesson?" You wrote that.
Conrad's eyes widen with realization.
Conrad: B.C. Bernardino Cruz. Principal Bernardino Cruz.
Conrad: It's been you all along.
Principal - B.C. - smiles gently.
Principal: You've grown perceptive, Conrad. Yes. I am B.C.
Mark: Wait, you... you've been leaving the cards? Guiding Conrad through all of this?
Principal: I have. Though I suspect you have questions.
Principal: Please, sit. This conversation has been long overdue.
They gesture to chairs on the stage.
Conrad and Mark sit, Conrad leaning forward intently.
Conrad: Why? Why the mystery? Why guide me through cases instead of just teaching directly?
Principal: Because direct teaching rarely transforms people, Conrad.
Principal: You can tell a student that honesty matters. They'll nod and forget within a week.
Principal: But if they experience the consequences of dishonesty, solve a case built on lies...
Conrad: They internalize the lesson. They feel it.
Principal: Exactly. Truth isn't just a concept to you anymore. It's something you've fought for.
Conrad: But you didn't create the cases, did you? You didn't make Greg cheat or Ria take the fund.
Principal: No. I would never manipulate students that way.
Principal: Those choices were theirs alone, born from their own struggles and pressures.
Principal: I simply observed. Watched human nature unfold as it always does.
Principal: And when opportunities arose - moments where moral lessons could be learned - I left cards.
Conrad: You guided me to solve cases I would have investigated anyway.
Principal: And in solving them, you learned far more than just who committed which act.
Principal: You learned about truth, responsibility, creativity, and wisdom.

"Diwata Laya" appears, and for the first time, she looks at Principal B.C. with recognition.
"Diwata Laya": [i][color=#9999ff]Ancient and patient. I sense it now.[/color][/i]
"Diwata Laya": [i][color=#9999ff]You have been teaching for many lifetimes, in many forms.[/color][/i]
Principal B.C. acknowledges Laya with a respectful nod.
Principal: Diwata Laya. I wondered when you would reveal yourself to him.
Principal: You've been an excellent guide as well.
"Diwata Laya": [i][color=#9999ff]We each teach in our own way. You through observation and patience.[/color][/i]
"Diwata Laya": [i][color=#9999ff]I through connection to truth and spirit.[/color][/i]
"Conrad (Thinking)": They know each other?
"Diwata Laya": [i][color=#9999ff]Not know. Recognize. Two guides working toward the same purpose.[/color][/i]

Mark: Okay, that was cryptic. But I'm more confused about something else.
Mark: Principal, you've been here the whole time. You dealt with each incident officially.
Mark: But you were also leaving cards, watching Conrad solve them. Why the dual role?
Principal: Because both roles were necessary.
Principal: As Principal, I had to ensure justice was served, students were protected, consequences were fair.
Principal: As B.C., I could guide Conrad to understand the deeper lessons beneath each case.
Principal: One role handles the immediate situation. The other plants seeds for long-term growth.
Conrad: How long have you been doing this? Leaving cards, teaching through observation?
Principal: Many years. Since before you arrived at this school.
Principal: I've guided other students in different ways. Each person needs different lessons.
Principal: You, Conrad, needed to learn how to see beneath the surface.
Principal: To understand that solving a mystery isn't just about finding the culprit.
Principal: It's about understanding why they made those choices, and what everyone can learn from them.
Conrad: The cards always appeared after I solved a case, never before.
Conrad: You wanted me to reach my own conclusions first.
Principal: Yes. Because if I told you the answers, you would learn nothing.
Principal: Discovery is the heart of real education.

Conrad stands, pacing thoughtfully.
Conrad: So each case... each lesson...
Conrad: They were all building toward something. Training me for something.

Principal: They were. But not for what you might think.
Principal: Come. There's one more thing you need to understand.
