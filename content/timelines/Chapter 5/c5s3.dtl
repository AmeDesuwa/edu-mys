Principal: Let me tell you about each case from my perspective.
Principal: Not as the Principal handling discipline, but as B.C., observing lessons unfold.
Principal picks up the chalk evidence.
Principal: Greg Santos. Brilliant student, crushing parental pressure.
Principal: I knew about his struggles weeks before the exam theft. I'd spoken to his parents, seen his declining grades.
Conrad: You knew he was at risk of cheating?
Principal: I knew he was under enormous stress. But I couldn't prevent him from making his own choice.
Principal: That's the key, Conrad. I could have intensified surveillance, made cheating impossible.
Principal: But then he wouldn't have learned anything.  He would have just resented the system.
Conrad: So you let it happen?
Principal: I didn't "let" it happen. I simply didn't rob him of his agency.
Principal: Greg chose to cheat. You chose to investigate. He chose to confess.
Principal: Each choice led to growth. His, and yours.
Principal: The lesson of Truth emerged naturally from those choices.
Principal moves to the budget papers arranged in a maze.
Principal: Ria. Desperate to help her family, tempted by accessible funds.
Mark: You knew she took the money?
Principal: Not immediately. But when it went missing, I suspected. Her family situation was dire.
Principal: I could have accused her directly. Demanded an immediate confession.
Conrad: But that would have shamed her without helping her understand why it was wrong.
Principal: Exactly. Instead, you investigated. You understood her desperation.
Principal: You helped her see that there were other ways to help her family. Legal ways.
Principal: The lesson of Responsibility came through understanding, not punishment.
Principal touches the art supplies and photo.
Principal: Victor. Talented but overshadowed. Jealous and invisible.
Principal: I watched him struggle for years. Saw his technical skill grow while his emotional expression stagnated.
Conrad: You knew he'd eventually lash out?
Principal: I knew his pain would find an outlet. But I didn't know what form it would take.
Principal: When Mia's sculpture was destroyed, I was saddened but not surprised.
Principal: Victor needed to hit bottom before he could rebuild himself with heart instead of just technique.
Principal: The lesson of Creativity - that art is about connection, not competition - had to come from his own mistake.
Finally, Principal picks up the journal.
Principal: And Alex. Finding that old journal was... serendipitous.
Principal: I'd almost forgotten it was still in the archive.
Conrad: You knew the educator who wrote it?
Principal: I was that educator's student, years ago.
Principal: They taught me about observation, about challenging students to think.
Principal: But they also taught me, through their mistakes, about the dangers of manipulation.
Principal: When Alex found the journal and began using it, I saw history repeating.
Principal: But this time, you were there to teach her what I learned the hard way.
Principal: The lesson of Wisdom - that knowledge requires ethical use - closed a circle decades in the making.
Conrad steps forward, understanding dawning.
Conrad: You didn't cause any of these events. You observed human nature.
Conrad: You saw students struggling with moral choices and let them make those choices.
Conrad: Then you guided me to help them learn from the consequences.
Principal: Yes. That's the philosophy of B.C.
Principal: True teaching isn't control. It's creating space for discovery.

"Diwata Laya": [i][color=#9999ff]You respect free will above all else. That is wisdom.[/color][/i]
"Diwata Laya": [i][color=#9999ff]Conrad has learned this too. He helps others learn from their choices, not by forcing them to change.[/color][/i]
Principal: Diwata Laya understands. As do you, Conrad, though perhaps you haven't articulated it yet.
"Conrad (Thinking)": I've become a teacher. Like B.C. Like Laya.
"Conrad (Thinking)": Not by lecturing people, but by helping them understand their own experiences.
"Diwata Laya": [i][color=#9999ff]The student has become the guide. The circle completes.[/color][/i]

Principal: There's one more lesson, Conrad. The most important one.
Principal: Are you ready to learn it?
Conrad nods solemnly.
Conrad: I am.
Principal: Then let's review what you've learned. To see it clearly, you must reflect deeply.
[signal arg="start_minigame lesson_reflection"]
Principal: Good. Your mind sees the connections now.
Principal: Each lesson built on the last. Truth, Responsibility, Creativity, Wisdom.
Principal: But they all serve one greater principle.
Conrad: Choice. Free will. The power to decide who we become.
Principal: Exactly. Are you ready for the final lesson?
