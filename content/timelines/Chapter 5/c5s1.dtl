The auditorium stage is empty, bathed in soft afternoon light.

Conrad and Mark arrange items carefully across the stage.
Conrad: Each case needs to be represented. But not just the crime - the lesson.
Mark: So how do we show that?
Conrad places a piece of chalk next to a small evidence bag.
Conrad: For the exam case - chalk and evidence. The lesson was Truth.
Conrad: Greg cheated, but the evidence revealed the truth. Honesty matters more than success.
He moves to the next position, arranging budget papers in a small maze pattern.
Conrad: For the missing fund - the maze of choices. The lesson was Responsibility.
Conrad: Ria made a choice out of desperation, but she had to face the consequences.
Mark helps arrange art supplies next to a photo of a sculpture.
Mark: The broken sculpture - Creativity. Victor learned that art is about expression, not competition.
Conrad: Right. And jealousy destroys what it cannot possess.
Finally, Conrad places the old journal carefully on a pedestal.
Conrad: The journal. Wisdom. Alex learned that knowledge without wisdom causes harm.
Mark: So what now? We just... wait?
Conrad pulls out a cream-colored card - one he prepared himself, matching B.C.'s style.
Conrad: I leave this.
He places the card in the center of the arrangement.
Mark: What does it say?
Conrad: "Teacher, I've learned your lessons. Each case taught me something about truth, responsibility, creativity, and wisdom. But I still have questions. Will you teach me one more lesson? - C"
Mark: Simple. Respectful. I like it.
Conrad: B.C. has always been patient, never forceful. This honors that.
Conrad: We're not setting a trap. We're extending an invitation.
Mark: So do we hide and wait to see if they show up?
Conrad: No. We wait outside. If B.C. wants to meet me, they'll send a signal.
Conrad: I'll leave the door unlocked. The rest is up to them.
They step back, examining their work.
The stage looks like a museum of moral lessons, each case represented with care.
Mark: This is either going to work brilliantly, or we're going to look really weird when the janitor finds this tomorrow.
Conrad: It'll work. B.C. has been guiding me all along. They'll recognize this for what it is.
Conrad: A student showing they understand their teacher.

Conrad and Mark sit on a bench outside the auditorium, waiting.

Mark: How long do we wait?
Conrad: As long as it takes.
Mark: What if B.C. is someone we know? Like... what if it's a teacher? Or a student?
Conrad: I've considered that. B.C. knows too much, has too much access.
Conrad: They've been at the school a long time. They understand its rhythms, its people.
Mark: The Principal? Ms. Santos? Janitor Fred?
Conrad: Any of them could be. Or someone else entirely.

The auditorium door opens quietly.
Someone has entered.
Conrad and Mark exchange glances.
Conrad: That's the signal. They're here.
Mark: So we go in?
Conrad: We give them a moment. Let them see the arrangement, read the card.
Conrad: Then we go in. Respectfully.
[wait time="1.5"]
Conrad stands, taking a deep breath.
Conrad: This is it. After four cases, four lessons, four cards...
Conrad: Finally, I meet my teacher.
