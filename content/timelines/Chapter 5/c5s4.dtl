Principal: Lesson Five. The lesson that encompasses all others.
Principal: Choice.
Conrad: I understand that now. Each person had a choice. Greg, Ria, Victor, Alex.
Conrad: They chose their actions. They learned from the consequences.
Principal: But there's more to it than that.
Principal: I had choices too. At every step.
Principal: When Greg was struggling, I could have prevented the exam theft entirely.
Principal: When the fund went missing, I could have revealed Ria immediately.
Principal: When Victor destroyed the sculpture, I could have caught him that very night.
Principal: When Alex began her moral experiments, I could have confiscated the journal weeks earlier.
Mark: Why didn't you?
Principal: Because preventing every mistake would rob students of the chance to grow.
Principal: Real learning comes from experiencing consequences, not from avoiding all failure.
Principal: But here's the crucial question, Conrad: Did I make the right choice?
Conrad considers carefully.
Conrad: You... prioritized long-term growth over short-term prevention.
Conrad: Each student learned something profound because they made mistakes and faced them.
Conrad: But... people were hurt. Mia lost her sculpture. Students felt manipulated by Alex.
Conrad: There's a cost to letting mistakes happen.
Principal: Exactly. And that's the heart of the final lesson.
Principal: Teaching through observation and guidance means accepting that people will sometimes choose poorly.
Principal: You can guide, but you can't control. And when you can't control, harm sometimes occurs.
Principal: The question isn't whether to prevent all harm. That's impossible while respecting free will.
Principal: The question is: How do we balance guidance with agency? Help with harm?
Conrad: You can't make people's choices for them. But you can help them understand their options.
Conrad: You can teach them how to think, not what to think.
Principal: Yes. And when they make mistakes - as they inevitably will - you can guide them to learn from those mistakes.
Principal: That's what you did, Conrad. In every case.
Principal: You didn't just solve mysteries. You helped people understand themselves.

"Conrad (Thinking)": Every case taught me something different about how to help people.
"Conrad (Thinking)": Greg needed compassion, not judgment. Ria needed understanding, not punishment.
"Conrad (Thinking)": Victor needed someone to see his pain. Alex needed someone to show her a better way.
"Diwata Laya": [i][color=#9999ff]And in helping them, you became more than a detective.[/color][/i]
"Diwata Laya": [i][color=#9999ff]You became a guide. A teacher. Someone who lights the path without forcing the journey.[/color][/i]

Principal: You've learned all five lessons, Conrad.
Principal: Truth - Evidence and honesty matter.
Principal: Responsibility - Actions have consequences that must be faced.
Principal: Creativity - Expression and connection matter more than competition.
Principal: Wisdom - Knowledge requires ethical, compassionate use.
Principal: And Choice - True teaching respects free will and guides without controlling.
Conrad stands, meeting Principal B.C.'s eyes with new understanding.
Conrad: So what happens now? Do you keep teaching? Keep leaving cards?
Principal: No. My work with you is complete.
Principal: You've graduated from student to teacher. You don't need my cards anymore.
Conrad: But the school will face more challenges. More students will struggle with moral choices.
Principal: They will. And you'll be there.
Principal: Not as B.C., leaving mysterious cards. But as Conrad, a student who helps others learn.
Principal: You'll guide in your own way. With your own wisdom.

Mark: So Conrad becomes the new teacher? That's a lot of pressure.
Principal: Not the new teacher. One of many teachers.
Principal: I'm still here. Diwata Laya guides from the spirit realm. Teachers and counselors guide in their ways.
Principal: Conrad simply adds his voice to the chorus. His unique perspective.
Conrad: I understand. But... will I see you again? As B.C., I mean?
Principal smiles.
Principal: You see me every day as the Principal. That won't change.
Principal: But as B.C.? My task is complete. The chain has served its purpose.
Principal: You learned the lessons. You became a guide.
Principal: Now the chain transforms. It doesn't end - it becomes something new.
Conrad: It becomes my own journey. My own way of helping others.
Principal: Exactly.

Conrad stands alone on the stage, surrounded by symbols of the five lessons he's learned.
Truth. Responsibility. Creativity. Wisdom. Choice.
Conrad: I entered this school as a student learning to observe.
Conrad: I became a detective learning to solve mysteries.
Conrad: And now... I'm a guide learning to help others grow.
Conrad: The chain doesn't end. It transforms.
join Mark (Mark_half) right
Mark: Heavy realizations, man. How do you feel?
Conrad: Grateful. Humbled. Ready.
Mark: Ready for what?
Conrad smiles.
Conrad: Whatever comes next. There will always be mysteries. Always people struggling with choices.
Conrad: And I'll be there. Not to solve everything for them.
Conrad: But to help them learn from their own experiences.
Conrad: Just like B.C. helped me.
