[SCENE: COMPUTER_LAB]

[set {c2s2_santos_tried} = false]
[set {c2s2_outsider_tried} = false]
[set {c2s2_alex_tried} = false]

The computer lab hums with the sound of cooling fans. Ryan sits alone at a terminal, typing rapidly.
[Conrad enters]
[Ryan enters]

Ryan looks up, his expression immediately guarded.

Ryan: Great. More people coming to interrogate me.

Conrad: We're not interrogating anyone. Just gathering information.

Ryan: That's what everyone says before they point fingers.

Conrad: We're trying to find the truth, Ryan. Not assign blame.

Ryan crosses his arms, but his posture relaxes slightly.

Ryan: Fine. What do you want to know?

Conrad: You were here yesterday evening. What were you working on?

Ryan: My budget proposal. The one the council rejected last week.

Conrad: Why were you revising a rejected proposal?

Ryan: Because they were wrong to reject it. I was adding more data to prove my point.

Ryan's voice rises with frustration.

Ryan: Do you know how much the council wastes on decorations? Fifteen thousand pesos for Foundation Day banners.

Ryan: Meanwhile, the basketball team is using balls held together with tape.

Conrad: That sounds frustrating.

Ryan: Frustrating doesn't begin to cover it. I've been fighting for better resource allocation for months.

Ryan: Nobody listens. They just smile and vote no.

Conrad: Where were you between 6\:30 and 7\:00 yesterday?

Ryan: Here. Printing documents. The printer kept jamming.

Conrad: Did you leave the lab at any point during that time?

Ryan hesitates for just a moment.

Ryan: I... went to the bathroom once. Maybe 6\:40? It was just a few minutes.

Conrad: Did you see anyone in the hallway?

Ryan: Ms. Santos was walking toward the cafeteria. Probably getting coffee.

Ryan: And I think I saw Alex heading toward the faculty room around the same time.

Conrad: Alex? The former treasurer?

Ryan shrugs.

Ryan: Yeah. She was carrying some folders. Probably club stuff.

Conrad: Anyone else?

Ryan: No. The building was pretty empty by then.

Ryan stands abruptly.

Ryan: Look, I didn't take the money. I have my complaints about the council, but I'm not a thief.

Ryan: Now if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.

Ryan returns to his computer, typing more aggressively than before.
[Ryan leaves]
[Mark enters]

Mark: He seemed pretty defensive. And that hesitation about leaving the lab...

Conrad: He admitted to being in the hallway around the same time Ms. Santos was away.

Conrad: And he mentioned seeing Alex near the faculty room. Interesting.

Conrad: Let's talk to Ms. Santos next.
[Conrad leaves]
[Mark leaves]

[SCENE: FACULTY_EMPTY]


The faculty room is quiet. Ms. Santos sits at her desk, surrounded by stacks of papers.
[Conrad enters]
[Ms enters]

"Ms Santos" looks up with tired eyes. Dark circles suggest she hasn't slept well.

She sighs heavily.

Ms Santos: More questions. I've already spoken to the principal twice.

Conrad: We're sorry to bother you, Ma'am. We just want to understand what happened.

Ms Santos: What's there to understand? I was careless, and now a student is being blamed for it.

Conrad: Can you walk us through yesterday evening?

Ms Santos: I was grading papers. Test week means mountains of work.

Ms Santos: I stayed until 8 PM to finish the Grade 9 exams.

Conrad: Did you leave your desk at any point?

"Ms Santos" fidgets with a pen, avoiding eye contact.

Ms Santos: I... took a coffee break around 6\:30. Maybe fifteen minutes.

Conrad: Did you lock your desk drawer before leaving?

Her voice drops to barely above a whisper.

Ms Santos: I'm not sure. I might have forgotten.

Ms Santos: With all the grading, I've been so scattered lately. Small things slip my mind.

Conrad: The council office key is kept in that drawer, correct?

Her tone becomes defensive.

Ms Santos: Yes. And I know what you're thinking.

Ms Santos: I'm the one who let this happen. If I had just remembered to lock it...

Conrad: We're not blaming you, Ma'am. We're trying to understand who had opportunity.

"Ms Santos" slumps in her chair.

Ms Santos: Anyone could have taken that key during my break. The faculty room door was unlocked.

Conrad: Did you see anyone when you returned from your break?

She pauses to think.

Ms Santos: When I was coming back... I think I saw Ryan. Near the stairwell.

Ms Santos: And now that I think about it... Alex was in the hallway too.

Conrad: Alex? The former treasurer?

Ms Santos: Yes. She said she was returning some club documents. Asked if she could leave them on my desk.

Ms Santos: I told her to just put them in the inbox by the door.

Conrad: What time was that?

Ms Santos: Around 6\:45. Maybe a few minutes before.

Conrad: Did Alex go into the faculty room?

Uncertainty crosses her face.

Ms Santos: I... I don't know. I went to get my coffee. She was still in the hallway when I left.

Conrad: Thank you, Ma'am. This is helpful.
[Ms leaves]
[Mark enters]

Mark: So both Ryan and Alex were near the faculty room during Ms. Santos's break.

Conrad: And Alex had a reason to be there. "Returning documents."

Mark: A perfect excuse to slip in and grab the key.

Conrad: We need to talk to Alex.
[Diwata enters]

[EVENT: laya_start]


Diwata Laya: Before confronting more witnesses, test your ability to recall details quickly.

[MINIGAME: curriculum:runner]


Diwata Laya: Good. Your memory sharpens.

[EVENT: laya_end]

[Diwata leaves]
[Conrad leaves]
[Mark leaves]

[SCENE: HALLWAY]


They find Alex near the bulletin board, studying the club announcements.
[Conrad enters]
[Alex enters]

Alex turns as they approach, her expression wary.

Alex: Let me guess. You're here about the missing money.

Conrad: Word travels fast.

Bitterness creeps into her voice.

Alex: Especially when people are looking for someone to blame besides precious Ria.

Conrad: You sound frustrated.

Alex: Wouldn't you be? I was treasurer for two years. Never lost a single peso.

Alex: Then Ria comes in with her "fresh ideas" and suddenly I'm yesterday's news.

Conrad: You were here yesterday evening. What were you doing?

Alex: Club committee meeting. We finished around 6\:30.

Conrad: And after that?

Alex: I had some old documents to return to the faculty room.

Alex: Club budget records from last year. They needed them for the audit.

Conrad: Did you go inside the faculty room?

Alex hesitates, crossing her arms defensively.

Alex: I... stepped in briefly. Ms. Santos wasn't there.

Alex: I left the folders in her inbox and left. That's it.

Conrad: Did you see anyone else?

Alex: Ryan was lurking around. Near the stairs.

Alex: He's always complaining about the budget. Wouldn't surprise me if he finally snapped.

Conrad: You seem to know a lot about what happened.

Alex's tone turns defensive.

Alex: Because I was there! And because I actually pay attention.

Alex: Unlike some people who just waltz in and take over positions they didn't earn.

Mark: You mean Ria?

Alex scoffs.

Alex: She made mistakes I never would have made. Leaving the lockbox unlocked overnight?

Alex: If I were still treasurer, this never would have happened.

Conrad: How do you know about Ria's mistake last year?

Alex's expression flickers for just a moment.

Alex: Everyone knows. Council gossip travels fast.

Alex: Look, I didn't take the money. I have nothing to prove and nothing to gain.

Alex: If you want a suspect, look at the guy who's been publicly ranting about budget waste for months.

Alex walks away before Conrad can ask more questions.
[Alex leaves]
[Mark enters]

Mark: She's bitter about being replaced. And she knew about Ria's mistake.

Conrad: She also admitted to being in the faculty room when Ms. Santos was gone.

Mark: Just like Ryan was in the hallway at the same time.

Conrad: Two people with motive. Two people with opportunity.

Conrad: The timeline is getting complicated.

Mark: So who do we focus on?

[LABEL: suspect_choice]


Conrad: Based on what we've learned, who should we focus on?
  → Ms. Santos is careless. Maybe she took the money herself. | 
[set {c2s2_santos_tried} = true]

[EVENT: wrong_choice]

[set {chapter2_score} -= 5]

Conrad: That doesn't fit. She has no motive, and she seemed genuinely distressed about forgetting to lock the drawer.

Conrad: Her guilt is about her carelessness, not about theft. She's not our culprit.
[JUMP TO: suspect_choice]
  → An outsider must have broken in. | 
[set {c2s2_outsider_tried} = true]

[EVENT: wrong_choice]

[set {chapter2_score} -= 5]

Conrad: There's no sign of forced entry anywhere. The school has security guards at the gates.

Conrad: And only someone with inside knowledge would know where the key was kept. This was an inside job.
[JUMP TO: suspect_choice]
  → Alex is bitter about being replaced. She had access and motive. | 
[set {c2s2_alex_tried} = true]

[EVENT: wrong_choice]

[set {chapter2_score} -= 5]

Conrad: Alex is bitter, but her motive doesn't quite fit.

Conrad: She wants to prove she was better than Ria. Stealing the fund would hurt students, not the council leadership.

Conrad: And if she wanted revenge, why now? She's had a whole year to act.
[JUMP TO: suspect_choice]
  → Ryan had motive and opportunity. He needs closer investigation.
[set {chapter2_score} += 10]

Conrad: Ryan was frustrated with the council's budget decisions.

Conrad: He had access to the hallway during Ms. Santos's break.

Conrad: And both witnesses saw him near the stairs at exactly the right time.

Conrad: Alex was there too, but Ryan's motive is more immediate. His proposal was just rejected.

Mark: So what do we do now?

Conrad: We need more evidence before we can confront either of them. Let's talk to Ria.

Conrad: Maybe she knows something else. Something that can help us narrow this down.
